<p/>SENSE AND SENSIBILITY

<p/>by Jane Austen

<p/>-LRB-1811-RRB-




<p/>CHAPTER 1


<p/>The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.  Their estate
was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of
their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so
respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their
surrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a single
man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister.  But her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
death, which happened ten years before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, produced a great
alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home; for to supply her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) loss, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) invited and received
into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house the family of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal
inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to
bequeath it.  In the society of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nephew and niece, and their
children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent.  His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
attachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. and
Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wishes, which proceeded not merely from
interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) every degree of solid
comfort which his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the
children added a relish to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) existence.

<p/>By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) present
lady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, was
amply provided for by the fortune of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, which had been large,
and half of which devolved on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) coming of age.  By his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own
marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) added to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
wealth.  To him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not
so really important as to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sisters; for their fortune, independent
of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that
property, could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their
father only seven thousand pounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own disposal; for the
remaining moiety of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first wife's fortune was also secured to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
child, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had only a life-interest in it.

<p/>The old gentleman died: his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will was read, and like almost every other
will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was neither so
unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) estate from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nephew;--but
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) left it to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on such terms as destroyed half the value of the
bequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wife
and daughters than for himself or his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) son;--but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) son, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as
to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or
by any sale of its valuable woods.  The whole was tied up for the
benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) father and
mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) uncle, by
such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three
years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh
all the value of all the attention which, for years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had received
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) niece and her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) daughters.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) meant not to be unkind, however,
and, as a mark of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) affection for the three girls, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) left them a
thousand pounds a-piece.

<p/>Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) temper was
cheerful and sanguine; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might reasonably hope to live many years,
and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce
of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate
improvement.  But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) only one twelvemonth.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) survived his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) uncle no longer; and ten
thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) widow and daughters.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) son was sent for as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) danger was known, and to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Mr.
Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness
could command, the interest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother-in-law and sisters.

<p/>Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the
family; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at
such a time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) promised to do every thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) power to make
them comfortable.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) father was rendered easy by such an assurance,
and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might
prudently be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) power to do for them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted
and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, in general, well
respected; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ordinary duties.  Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) married a more amiable woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
have been made still more respectable than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was:--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might even have
been made amiable himself; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very young when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) married, and
very fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.  But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature
of himself;--more narrow-minded and selfish.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meditated within himself to
increase the fortunes of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sisters by the present of a thousand
pounds a-piece.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then really thought himself equal to it.  The
prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present income,
besides the remaining half of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mother's fortune, warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
heart, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feel capable of generosity.-- <div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would give
them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would
be enough to make them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-- He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
not repent.

<p/>No sooner was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,
without sending any notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) intention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother-in-law,
arrived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) child and their attendants.  No one could dispute her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
right to come; the house was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband's from the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
father's decease; but the indelicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) conduct was so much the
greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common
feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there was
a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of
the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) a source of
immovable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with
any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband's family; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had had no opportunity, till the
present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of
other people she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) could act when occasion required it.

<p/>So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so
earnestly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter-in-law for it, that, on the
arrival of the latter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) would have quitted the house for ever, had
not the entreaty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eldest girl induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) first to reflect on the
propriety of going, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own tender love for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) three children
determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach
with their brother.

<p/>Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed
a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, and
enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,
that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led
to imprudence.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had an excellent heart;--her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disposition was
affectionate, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feelings were strong; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) knew how to govern
them: it was a knowledge which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother had yet to learn; and which
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sisters had resolved never to be taught.

<p/>Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sorrows, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
joys, could have no moderation.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was generous, amiable,
interesting: she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was everything but prudent.  The resemblance between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother was strikingly great.

<p/>Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's sensibility; but
by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished.  They encouraged each
other now in the violence of their affliction.  The agony of grief
which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought
for, was created again and again.  They gave themselves up wholly to
their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that
could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in
future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could
struggle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could exert herself.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could consult with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother,
could receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) arrival, and treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with
proper attention; and could strive to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother to similar
exertion, and encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to similar forbearance.

<p/>Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, without
having much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters at a more advanced period of life.



<p/>CHAPTER 2


<p/>Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.
As such, however, they were treated by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with quiet civility; and by
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband with as much kindness as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could feel towards anybody
beyond himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, and their child.  He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) really pressed them,
with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no
plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
invitation was accepted.

<p/>A continuance in a place where everything reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) of former
delight, was exactly what suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mind.  In seasons of cheerfulness,
no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater
degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness
itself.  But in sorrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) must be equally carried away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) fancy,
and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was beyond alloy.

<p/>Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband intended
to do for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sisters.  To take three thousand pounds from the fortune
of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to the most
dreadful degree.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to think again on the subject.  How
could he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answer it to himself to rob his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) child, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) only child too,
of so large a sum?  And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,
who were related to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) only by half blood, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) considered as no
relationship at all, have on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) generosity to so large an amount.  It
was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist
between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
money to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) half sisters?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my father's last request to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``that I
should assist his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) widow and daughters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
was light-headed at the time.  Had he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) been in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) right senses, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half
your fortune from your own child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) only
requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their
situation more comfortable than it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) power to do.  Perhaps it
would have been as well if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had left it wholly to myself.  He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could
hardly suppose I should neglect them.  But as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) required the promise,
I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.
The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.  Something
must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, LET something be done for them; but THAT something need
not be three thousand pounds.  Consider,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that when the
money is once parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters will
marry, and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could be restored
to our poor little boy--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) husband, very gravely, <div class="bookquote">``that would make
great difference.  The time may come when Harry will regret that so
large a sum was parted with.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should have a numerous family, for
instance, it would be a very convenient addition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure it would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were
diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious
increase to their fortunes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth would do half so
much for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sisters, even if REALLY his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sisters!  And as it is--only
half blood!--But you have such a generous spirit!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not wish to do any thing mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) replied.  <div class="bookquote">``One had rather,
on such occasions, do too much than too little.  No one, at least, can
think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly
expect more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no knowing what THEY may expect,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, <div class="bookquote">``but we are
not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can
afford to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds
a-piece.  As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have
about three thousand pounds on their mother's death--a very comfortable
fortune for any young woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no
addition at all.  They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst
them.  If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do
not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten
thousand pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the
whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother
while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind I
mean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.
A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) consent to this
plan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it is better than parting with fifteen hundred
pounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years
we shall be completely taken in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life cannot be worth half that
purchase.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when
there is an annuity to be paid them; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is very stout and healthy,
and hardly forty.  An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over
and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.  You are not
aware of what you are doing.  I have known a great deal of the trouble
of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to
old superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is amazing how
disagreeable she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) found it.  Twice every year these annuities were to be
paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then
one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be
no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) income was not her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
own, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more
unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been
entirely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.  It
has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would
not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is certainly an unpleasant thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood/Mr. Henry Dashwood</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Dashwood, <div class="bookquote">``to have
those kind of yearly drains on one's income.  One's fortune, as your
mother justly says, is NOT one's own.  To be tied down to the regular
payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it
takes away one's independence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood/Mr. Henry Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.  They think
themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises
no gratitude at all.  If I were you, whatever I did should be done at
my own discretion entirely.  I would not bind myself to allow them any
thing yearly.  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a
hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should
be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will
be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they
would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger
income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the
year.  It will certainly be much the best way.  A present of fifty
pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for
money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within
myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at
all.  The assistance he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought of, I dare say, was only such as might
be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a
comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,
and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they
are in season.  I'll lay my life that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant nothing farther; indeed,
it would be very strange and unreasonable if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did.  Do but consider,
my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law
and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,
besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which
brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will
pay their mother for their board out of it.  Altogether, they will have
five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want
for more than that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will
be nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly
any servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of
any kind!  Only conceive how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a
year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as
to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.  They will
be much more able to give YOU something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood/Mr. Henry Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Dashwood, <div class="bookquote">``I believe you are perfectly right.
My father certainly could mean nothing more by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) request to me than
what you say.  I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil
my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you
have described.  When my mother removes into another house my services
shall be readily given to accommodate her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as far as I can.  Some little
present of furniture too may be acceptable then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood/Mr. Henry Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  <div class="bookquote">``But, however, ONE thing
must be considered.  When your father and mother moved to Norland,
though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and
linen was saved, and is now left to your mother.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house will
therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) takes it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A valuable legacy
indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant
addition to our own stock here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what
belongs to this house.  A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for
any place THEY can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.
Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this: that you owe no
particular gratitude to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), nor attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wishes; for we very
well know that if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have left almost everything in the
world to THEM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) intentions whatever of
decision was wanting before; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) finally resolved, that it would be
absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the
widow and children of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own wife pointed out.



<p/>CHAPTER 3


<p/>Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any
disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased
to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) spirits began to revive, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mind became capable of some other
exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy
remembrances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for
to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) could
hear of no situation that at once answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) notions of comfort and
ease, and suited the prudence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eldest daughter, whose steadier
judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother would have approved.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband of the solemn promise on
the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) son in their favour, which gave comfort to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last
earthly reflections.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) doubted the sincerity of this assurance no
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had doubted it himself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thought of it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
daughters' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was
persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) in
affluence.  For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own
heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) rejoiced; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) reproached herself for being unjust to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
merit before, in believing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) incapable of generosity.  His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) attentive
behaviour to herself and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sisters convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) that their welfare
was dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and, for a long time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) firmly relied on the
liberality of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) intentions.

<p/>The contempt which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) character, which half a year's residence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) family afforded;
and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal
affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it
impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular
circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to
the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters' continuance at Norland.

<p/>This circumstance was a growing attachment between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eldest girl and
the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young
man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sister's
establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) time there.

<p/>Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of
interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died
very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,
for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune depended on the
will of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother.  But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either
consideration.  It was enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to be amiable,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.
It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune
should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
disposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged by
every one who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) comprehension impossible.

<p/>Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any
peculiar graces of person or address.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was not handsome, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
manners required intimacy to make them pleasing.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was too diffident
to do justice to himself; but when his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) natural shyness was overcome,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) understanding was good, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) education had given it solid
improvement.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to
answer the wishes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) mother and sister, who longed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.  They wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) to make a
fine figure in the world in some manner or other.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) mother wished to
interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) in political concerns, to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) into parliament, or to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) connected with some of the great men of the day.  Mrs. John
Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these
superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
ambition to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) driving a barouche.  But Edward had no turn for
great men or barouches.  All his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wishes centered in domestic comfort
and the quiet of private life.  Fortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had a younger brother
who was more promising.

<p/>Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) engaged
much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was, at that time, in such
affliction as rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) careless of surrounding objects.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) saw
only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was quiet and unobtrusive, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for it.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
did not disturb the wretchedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mind by ill-timed conversation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was first called to observe and approve him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) farther, by a
reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister.  It was a contrast which recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
most forcibly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is unlike Fanny is enough.
It implies everything amiable.  I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you will like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``when you know more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother with a smile.  <div class="bookquote">``I feel no sentiment of
approbation inferior to love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) manners
were attaching, and soon banished his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reserve.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) speedily
comprehended all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) merits; the persuasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard for Elinor
perhaps assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) penetration; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really felt assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be, was no
longer uninteresting when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart to be warm and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temper
affectionate.

<p/>No sooner did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) perceive any symptom of love in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behaviour to
Elinor, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) considered their serious attachment as certain, and
looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a few months, my dear Marianne.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Elinor will, in all
probability be settled for life.  We shall miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); but SHE will be
happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My love, it will be scarcely a separation.  We shall live within a few
miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives.  You will
gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest
opinion in the world of Edward's heart.  But you look grave, Marianne;
do you disapprove your sister's choice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``I may consider it with some surprise.
Edward is very amiable, and I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tenderly.  But yet--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is not
the kind of young man--there is something wanting--his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) figure is not
striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man
who could seriously attach my sister.  His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes want all that spirit,
that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence.  And besides
all this, I am afraid, Mama, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no real taste.  Music seems
scarcely to attract him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admires Elinor's drawings very
much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their
worth.  It is evident, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) frequent attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) draws, that in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows nothing of the matter.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admires as
a lover, not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters must be
united.  I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every
point coincide with my own.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must enter into all my feelings; the
same books, the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how
spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!
I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bore it with so much
composure, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) seemed scarcely to notice it.  I could hardly keep my
seat.  To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost
driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such
dreadful indifference!'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>-- <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would certainly have done more justice to
simple and elegant prose.  I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) Cowper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Mama, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allow
for difference of taste.  Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
may overlook it, and be happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).  But it would have broke MY
heart, had I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) read with so little sensibility.
Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I
shall never see a man whom I can really love.  I require so much!  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
must have all Edward's virtues, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) person and manners must
ornament his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) goodness with every possible charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.  It is yet too early in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 4


<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity it is, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``that Edward should have no
taste for drawing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No taste for drawing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``why should you think so? He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
does not draw himself, indeed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has great pleasure in seeing the
performances of other people, and I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is by no means
deficient in natural taste, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has not had opportunities of
improving it.  Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ever been in the way of learning, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
would have drawn very well.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) distrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own judgment in such
matters so much, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is always unwilling to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opinion on any
picture; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which
in general direct him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) perfectly right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but
the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) by the
drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,
which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though
smiling within herself at the mistake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) honoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister for that
blind partiality to Edward which produced it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``you do not consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as
deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,
for your behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your
opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would not wound the feelings of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister on any account, and yet to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not believe was
impossible.  At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is not in every thing
equal to your sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) merits.  I have not had so many
opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mind, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
inclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in
the world of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) goodness and sense.  I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) every thing that is
worthy and amiable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dearest friends
could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that.  I do not
perceive how you could express yourself more warmly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne was rejoiced to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister so easily pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sense and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) goodness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``no one can, I
think, be in doubt, who has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) often enough to engage him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in
unreserved conversation.  The excellence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) understanding and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) silent.  You know enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) solid worth.
But of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) minuter propensities, as you call them you have from
peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and I
have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been
wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother.  I
have seen a great deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), have studied his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sentiments and heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I
venture to pronounce that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books
exceedingly great, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) imagination lively, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) observation just and
correct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) taste delicate and pure.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) abilities in every
respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) manners and person.
At first sight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) address is certainly not striking; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) person
can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes, which
are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) countenance, is
perceived.  At present, I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) so well, that I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really
handsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you, Marianne?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall very soon think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) handsome, Elinor, if I do not now.  When
you tell me to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face, than I now do in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
had been betrayed into, in speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt that Edward stood
very high in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed the regard to be mutual; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of
their attachment agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew that what Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,
to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tried to explain
the real state of the case to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not attempt to deny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I think very highly of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)--that I greatly esteem, that I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne here burst forth with indignation--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)! Like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!  worse than
cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.  Use those words again, and I
will leave the room this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could not help laughing.  <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and be assured
that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my
own feelings.  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;
believe them, in short, to be such as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) merit, and the suspicion--the
hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly.
But farther than this you must not believe.  I am by no means assured
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard for me.  There are moments when the extent of it seems
doubtful; and till his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at
my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by
believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart I feel
little--scarcely any doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) preference.  But there are other
points to be considered besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) inclination.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is very far from
being independent.  What his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother really is we cannot know; but, from
Fanny's occasional mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conduct and opinions, we have never
been disposed to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) amiable; and I am very much mistaken if
Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) way, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great
fortune or high rank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother
and herself had outstripped the truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you really are not engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">``Yet it certainly
soon will happen.  But two advantages will proceed from this delay.  I
shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of
improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be
so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.  Oh! if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should
be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how
delightful it would be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) real opinion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not
consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne
had believed it.  There was, at times, a want of spirits about him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as
unpromising.  A doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) regard, supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to feel it, need not
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) more than inquietude.  It would not be likely to produce that
dejection of mind which frequently attended him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).  A more reasonable
cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the
indulgence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother neither behaved
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) so as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) home comfortable at present, nor to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
any assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might form a home for himself, without strictly
attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) views for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge
as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was far from depending on that result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) preference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother and sister still considered as certain.  Nay, the longer
they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard;
and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed it to be no more
than friendship.

<p/>But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uneasy, and at the same time, -LRB-which was
still more common,-RRB- to make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uncivil.  She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took the first
opportunity of affronting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so expressively of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother's great expectations, of Mrs.
Ferrars's resolution that both her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sons should marry well, and of the
danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that
Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to
be calm.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) an answer which marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) contempt, and
instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the
inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) beloved Elinor
should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.

<p/>In this state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits, a letter was delivered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) from the
post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed.  It was the
offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.  The
letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit
of friendly accommodation.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was in need of a
dwelling; and though the house he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) now offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was merely a cottage,
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that everything should be done to it which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might
think necessary, if the situation pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) earnestly pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) daughters to Barton Park, the place of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) own residence, from
whence she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses
were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of
giving pleasure to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) cousin; more especially at a moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) nearer
connections.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) needed no time for deliberation or inquiry.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
resolution was formed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) read.  The situation of Barton, in a
county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours
before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every
possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first
recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an
evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of
the misery of continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for
ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or
visit it while such a woman was its mistress.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) instantly wrote Sir
John Middleton her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) kindness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) acceptance
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
daughters, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might be secure of their approbation before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
answer were sent.

<p/>Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle
at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present
acquaintance.  On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to oppose
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.  The house, too, as
described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so
uncommonly moderate, as to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) no right of objection on either
point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm
to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wishes, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made no attempt to dissuade her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother from
sending a letter of acquiescence.



<p/>CHAPTER 5


<p/>No sooner was her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself
in the pleasure of announcing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) son-in-law and his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) wife that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than till
every thing were ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) inhabiting it. They heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) with
surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband civilly hoped
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) would not be settled far from Norland. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had great
satisfaction in replying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was going into Devonshire.--Edward
turned hastily towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise
and concern, which required no explanation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), repeated,
<div class="bookquote">``Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to
what part of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) explained the situation. It was within four miles
northward of Exeter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is but a cottage,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``but I hope to see many of my
friends in it.  A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends
find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will
find none in accommodating them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood
to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) at Barton; and to Edward she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) gave one with still greater
affection.  Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) late conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter-in-law had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was
unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) in that
point to which it principally tended.  To separate Edward and Elinor
was as far from being her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) object as ever; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished to show Mrs.
John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) brother, how totally
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disregarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disapprobation of the match.

<p/>Mr. John Dashwood told his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother again and again how exceedingly sorry
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to
prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) being of any service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) in removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) furniture.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very
exertion to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had limited the performance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture
was all sent around by water.  It chiefly consisted of household linen,
plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.
Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) could not
help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income would be so
trifling in comparison with their own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) should have any handsome
article of furniture.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might have immediate possession.  No difficulty arose on either
side in the agreement; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) waited only for the disposal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
effects at Norland, and to determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) future household, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
set off for the west; and this, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was exceedingly rapid in the
performance of everything that interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), was soon done.--The
horses which were left her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband had been sold soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) carriage,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eldest
daughter.  For the comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) children, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) consulted only her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
own wishes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor
prevailed.  HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to
three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from
amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.

<p/>The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,
to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as Lady
Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) preferred going
directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as to
feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entered it as her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by
the evident satisfaction of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) daughter-in-law in the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed
under a cold invitation to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to defer her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) departure.  Now was the
time when her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) son-in-law's promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) father might with particular
propriety be fulfilled.  Since he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) had neglected to do it on first
coming to the estate, their quitting his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) house might be looked on as
the most suitable period for its accomplishment.  But Mrs. Dashwood
began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced,
from the general drift of his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) discourse, that his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) assistance extended
no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.  He (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) so
frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of
the perpetual demands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) purse, which a man of any consequence in
the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) seemed rather to
stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving
money away.

<p/>In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton's
first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future
abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters to begin their
journey.

<p/>Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so
much beloved.  <div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear Norland!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wandered
alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; <div class="bookquote">``when
shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!
happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this
spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, ye
well-known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay
because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we
can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same; unconscious
of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any
change in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain to
enjoy you?''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 6


<p/>The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a
disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant.  But as they
drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a
country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view
of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.  It was a
pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture.  After winding
along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.  A small
green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket
gate admitted them into it.

<p/>As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;
but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the
roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were
the walls covered with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly
through the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the entrance
was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the
offices and the stairs.  Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest
of the house.  It had not been built many years and was in good repair.
In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears
which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon
dried away.  They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their
arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.
It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from first
seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an
impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending
it to their lasting approbation.

<p/>The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose immediately
behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open
downs, the others cultivated and woody.  The village of Barton was
chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the
cottage windows.  The prospect in front was more extensive; it
commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.
The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that
direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out
again between two of the steepest of them.

<p/>With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the
whole well satisfied; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) former style of life rendered many
additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a
delight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had at this time ready money enough to supply
all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.  <div class="bookquote">``As for the
house itself, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it is too small for our family,
but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it
is too late in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring, if I
have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about
building.  These parlors are both too small for such parties of our
friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts
of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the
other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this,
with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber
and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.  I could
wish the stairs were handsome.  But one must not expect every thing;
though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.  I
shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and
we will plan our improvements accordingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the
savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it
was; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,
and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to
form themselves a home.  Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and
properly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls
of their sitting room.

<p/>In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast
the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome
them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) own
house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.  Sir
John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had formerly
visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) young cousins to
remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>).  His (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
manners were as friendly as the style of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) letter.  Their arrival
seemed to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) real satisfaction, and their comfort to be an
object of real solicitude to him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) said much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) earnest desire
of their living in the most sociable terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) family, and pressed
them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were
better settled at home, that, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) entreaties were carried to a
point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>)
left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from
the park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of
game.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and
from the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of
sending them his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) newspaper every day.

<p/>Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>), denoting her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) could be assured
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was
answered by an invitation equally polite, her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) ladyship was introduced
to them the next day.

<p/>They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of
their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) appearance
was favourable to their wishes.  Lady Middleton was not more than six
or seven and twenty; her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) face was handsome, her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) figure tall and
striking, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) address graceful.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) manners had all the elegance
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) husband's wanted.  But they would have been improved by some
share of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) frankness and warmth; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) visit was long enough to
detract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, though
perfectly well-bred, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for
herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.

<p/>Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and
Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) their
eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means
there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of
extremity, for they had to enquire his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name and age, admire his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) beauty,
and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) questions which his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother answered for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hung
about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and held down his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, to the great surprise of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
ladyship, who wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) being so shy before company, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could
make noise enough at home.  On every formal visit a child ought to be
of the party, by way of provision for discourse.  In the present case
it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
father or mother, and in what particular he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) resembled either, for of
course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the
opinion of the others.

<p/>An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the
rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house without
securing their promise of dining at the park the next day.



<p/>CHAPTER 7


<p/>Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.  The ladies had
passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from
their view at home by the projection of a hill.  The house was large
and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality
and elegance.  The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latter
for that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) lady.  They were scarcely ever without some friends
staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every
kind than any other family in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary to
the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward
behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of
talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with
such as society produced, within a very narrow compass.  Sir John was a
sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother.  He (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) hunted and shot, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
humoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) children; and these were their only resources.  Lady
Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) children all the
year round, while Sir John's independent employments were in existence
only half the time.  Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,
supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the
good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>)
wife.

<p/>Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) table, and of
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
greatest enjoyment in any of their parties.  But Sir John's
satisfaction in society was much more real; he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) delighted in collecting
about him (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) more young people than his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) house would hold, and the noisier
they were the better was he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) pleased.  He (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) was a blessing to all the
juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) was for ever
forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter
his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not
suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.

<p/>The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy
to him (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>), and in every point of view he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) was charmed with the inhabitants
he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) had now procured for his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods were
young, pretty, and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) good
opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind as captivating as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) person.  The friendliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>)
disposition made him (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) happy in accommodating those, whose situation
might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  In
showing kindness to his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) cousins therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) had the real satisfaction
of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>)
cottage, he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) esteems only those of his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) sex who are sportsmen likewise, is
not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a
residence within his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) own manor.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters were met at the door of the house by
Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young
ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) the day
before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.  They
would see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a
particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very
young nor very gay.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) hoped they would all excuse the smallness of
the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>)
had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some
addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full
of engagements.  Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton
within the last hour, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a very cheerful agreeable woman,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might
imagine.  The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly
satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for
no more.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry,
fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and
rather vulgar.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner
was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and
husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,
and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.  Marianne was
vexed at it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's sake, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes towards Elinor
to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave
Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery
as Mrs. Jennings's.

<p/>Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by
resemblance of manner to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) friend, than Lady Middleton was to be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was
silent and grave.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old
bachelor, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) face was not handsome, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) countenance was sensible, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
address was particularly gentlemanlike.

<p/>There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as
companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton
was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of
Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
mother-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to
enjoyment only by the entrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) four noisy children after dinner,
who pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) about, tore her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) clothes, and put an end to every kind of
discourse except what related to themselves.

<p/>In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was
invited to play.  The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to
be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went
through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into
the family on her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in
the same position on the pianoforte, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) ladyship had celebrated
that event by giving up music, although by her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother's account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
had played extremely well, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own was very fond of it.

<p/>Marianne's performance was highly applauded.  Sir John was loud in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) conversation
with the others while every song lasted.  Lady Middleton frequently
called him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) to order, wondered how any one's attention could be diverted
from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song
which Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone, of all the
party, heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) without being in raptures.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) only the
compliment of attention; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) felt a respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) on the
occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless
want of taste.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that
ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) own, was
estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the
others; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and
thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every
exquisite power of enjoyment.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was perfectly disposed to make every
allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanity
required.



<p/>CHAPTER 8


<p/>Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had only two
daughters, both of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had lived to see respectably married, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the
world.  In the promotion of this object she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was zealously active, as
far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting
weddings among all the young people of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) acquaintance.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was
remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the
advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by
insinuations of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) power over such a young man; and this kind of
discernment enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arrival at Barton decisively to
pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne
Dashwood.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening
of their being together, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) listening so attentively while she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
sang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons' dining
at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) again.
It must be so.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was perfectly convinced of it.  It would be an
excellent match, for HE (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was rich, and SHE was handsome.  Mrs. Jennings
had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
connection with Sir John first brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) knowledge; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.

<p/>The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for
it supplied her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) with endless jokes against them both.  At the park she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne.  To the former
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,
perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first
incomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hardly knew
whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel's
advanced years, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) forlorn condition as an old bachelor.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than
herself, so exceedingly ancient as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to the youthful fancy of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of
wishing to throw ridicule on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,
though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured.  Colonel Brandon
is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) is old enough to be MY
father; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) were ever animated enough to be in love, must have
long outlived every sensation of the kind.  It is too ridiculous!  When
is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not
protect him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Infirmity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``do you call Colonel Brandon infirm?  I can
easily suppose that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) age may appear much greater to you than to my
mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) having the use of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) limbs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did not you hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) complain of the rheumatism?  and is not that the
commonest infirmity of declining life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest child,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``at this rate you must
be in continual terror of MY decay; and it must seem to you a miracle
that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mama, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well that Colonel
Brandon is not old enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) friends yet apprehensive of
losing him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in the course of nature.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) may live twenty years longer.
But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``thirty-five and seventeen had better not have
any thing to do with matrimony together.  But if there should by any
chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should
not think Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
marrying HER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A woman of seven and twenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, after pausing a moment,
<div class="bookquote">``can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) home be
uncomfortable, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fortune small, I can suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) might bring
herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the
provision and security of a wife.  In his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) marrying such a woman
therefore there would be nothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact of
convenience, and the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would be
no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.  To me it would seem
only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the
expense of the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be impossible, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``to convince you that
a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five
anything near enough to love, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a desirable companion to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife to the
constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) chanced to
complain yesterday -LRB-a very cold damp day-RRB- of a slight rheumatic feel in
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shoulders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) talked of flannel waistcoats,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne; <div class="bookquote">``and with me a
flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,
rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and
the feeble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
half so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to
you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room, <div class="bookquote">``Mama,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said
Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot
conceal from you.  I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have now
been here almost a fortnight, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) does not come.  Nothing but
real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.  What else
can detain him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) at Norland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you any idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) coming so soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood.  <div class="bookquote">``I had
none.  On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the
subject, it has been in recollecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) sometimes showed a want of
pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
coming to Barton.  Does Elinor expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never mentioned it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), but of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) observed
that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the
room would be wanted for some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!  But the whole of
their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how
composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the
last evening of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was no
distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an
affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave them purposely
together in the course of the last morning, and each time did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) most
unaccountably follow me out of the room.  And Elinor, in quitting
Norland and Edward, cried not as I did.  Even now her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) self-command is
invariable.  When is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dejected or melancholy? When does she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) try to
avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?''



 (<font color='red'><b>Barton</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 9


<p/>The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to
themselves.  The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding
them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had
given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater
enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their
father.  Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first
fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at
home, could not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) amazement on finding them always employed.

<p/>Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in
spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the
neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) carriage being always at
their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the
wish of society for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) children; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was resolute in declining to
visit any family beyond the distance of a walk.  There were but few who
could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.
About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding
valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly
described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an
ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little
of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be
better acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry, that its
possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately
too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.

<p/>The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.  The high
downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to
seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy
alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior
beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one
memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine
of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the
settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned.  The weather was
not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their
book, in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would be
lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off
from their hills; and the two girls set off together.

<p/>They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at
every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the
animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears
which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such
delightful sensations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there a felicity in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``superior to
this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting
it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly
the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in
their face.-- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though
unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own
house.  One consolation however remained for them, to which the
exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that of
running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which
led immediately to their garden gate.

<p/>They set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop
herself to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the
bottom in safety.

<p/>A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), was
passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
accident happened.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gun and ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) assistance.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
had raised herself from the ground, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) foot had been twisted in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was scarcely able to stand.  The gentleman offered
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) services; and perceiving that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) modesty declined what her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
situation rendered necessary, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) up in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms without farther
delay, and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,
the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) directly
into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
hold till he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had seated her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in a chair in the parlour.

<p/>Elinor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while
the eyes of both were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with an evident wonder and a secret
admiration which equally sprung from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appearance, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) apologized for
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so
graceful that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) person, which was uncommonly handsome, received
additional charms from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) voice and expression.  Had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) been even old,
ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would
have been secured by any act of attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) child; but the
influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the
action which came home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feelings.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which
always attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), invited him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to be seated.  But this he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) declined,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was dirty and wet.  Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
was obliged.  His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) replied, was Willoughby, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) present
home was at Allenham, from whence he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) would allow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) the
honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood.  The honour
was readily granted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) then departed, to make himself still more
interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the
theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gallantry raised
against Marianne received particular spirit from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) exterior
attractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Mama the
rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) face, on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lifting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) up, had robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) of the power of regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) after their
entering the house.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had seen enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to join in all the
admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
praise.  His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) person and air were equal to what her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fancy had ever drawn
for the hero of a favourite story; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) into the
house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of
thought which particularly recommended the action to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  Every
circumstance belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was interesting.  His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) name was good, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
residence was in their favourite village, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) soon found out that
of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
imagination was busy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a
sprained ankle was disregarded.

<p/>Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather
that morning allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) to get out of doors; and Marianne's accident
being related to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was eagerly asked whether he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) knew any
gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Willoughby!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Sir John; <div class="bookquote">``what, is HE (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) in the country? That is good
news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) to dinner on
Thursday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)! to be sure I do.  Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is down here every year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what sort of a young man is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.  A very decent
shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that all you can say for him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, indignantly.
<div class="bookquote">``But what are his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>)
pursuits, his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) talents, and genius?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir John was rather puzzled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I do not know much about him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) as to all THAT.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest
little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw.  Was she (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) out with him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>)
today?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Marianne could no more satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) as to the colour of Mr.
Willoughby's pointer, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could describe to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) the shades of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor.  <div class="bookquote">``Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) come from?  Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) a
house at Allenham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own in the
country; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) resided there only while he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was visiting the old lady
at Allenham Court, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was related, and whose possessions he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was
to inherit; adding, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is very well worth catching I can
tell you, Miss Dashwood; he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has a pretty little estate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own in
Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) up to my
younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.  Miss
Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.  Brandon will
be jealous, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) does not take care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,
<div class="bookquote">``that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY
daughters towards what you call CATCHING him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).  It is not an employment
to which they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us, let
them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however, from what you say,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not
be ineligible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>repeated
Sir John.  <div class="bookquote">``I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
danced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, <div class="bookquote">``and with
elegance, with spirit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was up again at eight to ride to covert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be.  Whatever
be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursuits, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eagerness in them should know no moderation, and
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no sense of fatigue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, I see how it will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Sir John, <div class="bookquote">``I see how it will be.
You will be setting your cap at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now, and never think of poor
Brandon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is an expression, Sir John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, warmly, <div class="bookquote">``which I
particularly dislike.  I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit
is intended; and `setting one's cap at a man,' or `making a conquest,'
are the most odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and
if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago
destroyed all its ingenuity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed as
heartily as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, and then replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.
Poor Brandon! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is quite smitten already, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very well worth
setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling
about and spraining of ankles.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 10


<p/>Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,
styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) personal enquiries.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more
than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the
visit tended to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,
and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).  Of their personal charms he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had not required a second interview
to be convinced.

<p/>Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a
remarkably pretty figure.  Marianne was still handsomer.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) form,
though not so correct as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's, in having the advantage of
height, was more striking; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) face was so lovely, that when in the
common cant of praise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was called a beautiful girl, truth was less
violently outraged than usually happens.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) skin was very brown, but,
from its transparency, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
features were all good; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) smile was sweet and attractive; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness,
which could hardily be seen without delight.  From Willoughby their
expression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the
remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) assistance created.  But when this passed away, when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits became collected, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw that to the perfect
good-breeding of the gentleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) united frankness and vivacity, and
above all, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) declare, that of music and dancing he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
passionately fond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) such a look of approbation as secured
the largest share of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) discourse to herself for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stay.

<p/>It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
to talk.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not be silent when such points were introduced, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.  They speedily
discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and
that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related
to either.  Encouraged by this to a further examination of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
opinions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) proceeded to question him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on the subject of books; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous
a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been
insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence
of such works, however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly
alike.  The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--or if
any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than
till the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) arguments and the brightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes could be
displayed.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acquiesced in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) decisions, caught all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
enthusiasm; and long before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visit concluded, they conversed with
the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left them, <div class="bookquote">``for ONE
morning I think you have done pretty well.  You have already
ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of
importance.  You know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are
certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) estimating their beauties as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) ought, and you have
received every assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) admiring Pope no more than is proper.
But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such
extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?  You will soon
have exhausted each favourite topic.  Another meeting will suffice to
explain his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and
then you can have nothing farther to ask.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so
scanty?  But I see what you mean.  I have been too much at my ease, too
happy, too frank.  I have erred against every common-place notion of
decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been
reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had I talked only of the
weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this
reproach would have been spared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My love,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``you must not be offended with Elinor--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was only in jest.  I should scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) myself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) were capable of
wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new
friend.'' (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>-- Marianne was softened in a moment.

<p/>Willoughby, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) side, gave every proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) pleasure in their
acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
came to them every day.  To enquire after Marianne was at first his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
excuse; but the encouragement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) reception, to which every day gave
greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased
to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was confined for
some days to the house; but never had any confinement been less
irksome.  Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick
imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was
exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) joined
not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was
now roused and increased by the example of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own, and which
recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) affection beyond every thing else.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) society became gradually her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) most exquisite enjoyment.  They read,
they talked, they sang together; his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) musical talents were considerable;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had
unfortunately wanted.

<p/>In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was as faultless as in Marianne's; and
Elinor saw nothing to censure in him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) but a propensity, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, of saying too
much what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or
circumstances.  In hastily forming and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opinion of other
people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided
attention where his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the
forms of worldly propriety, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) displayed a want of caution which Elinor
could not approve, in spite of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and Marianne could say in
its support.

<p/>Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was
all that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every
brighter period, as capable of attaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) behaviour
declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) abilities
were strong.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their
marriage had been raised, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) prospect of riches, was led before the
end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate
herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.

<p/>Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so early been
discovered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when
it ceased to be noticed by them.  Their attention and wit were drawn
off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had
incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) feelings
began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.
Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments
which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own satisfaction, were now
actually excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister; and that however a general resemblance
of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.
Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no
hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) saw it with concern;
for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a
very lively one of five and twenty? and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) could not even wish him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
successful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) heartily wished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indifferent.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gravity and reserve, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) beheld in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an object of
interest.  His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners, though serious, were mild; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reserve
appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any
natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John had dropped hints of past
injuries and disappointments, which justified her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) belief of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being
an unfortunate man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with respect and compassion.

<p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pitied and esteemed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the more because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was slighted by
Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) for being neither
lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) merits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brandon is just the kind of man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>said Willoughby one day, when they
were talking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) together, <div class="bookquote">``whom every body speaks well of, and
nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers
to talk to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not boast of it, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``for it is injustice in
both of you.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and
I never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) myself without taking pains to converse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is patronised by YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>replied Willoughby, <div class="bookquote">``is certainly in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in
itself.  Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a
woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the
indifference of any body else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will
make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother.  If their
praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more
undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My protege, as you call him (<font color='blue'><b>protege</b></font>), is a sensible man; and sense will always
have attractions for me.  Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty
and forty.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, has
read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) capable of giving me
much information on various subjects; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has always answered my
inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne contemptuously, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has told you, that
in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are
troublesome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries,
but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>said Willoughby, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) observations may have extended to the
existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may venture to say that HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) observations have stretched much further
than your candour.  But why should you dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).  I consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), on the contrary, as a very
respectable man, who has every body's good word, and nobody's notice;
who, has more money than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can spend, more time than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows how to
employ, and two new coats every year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Add to which,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has neither genius, taste, nor
spirit.  That his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understanding has no brilliancy, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings no
ardour, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice no expression.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You decide on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imperfections so much in the mass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor,
<div class="bookquote">``and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the
commendation I am able to give of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is comparatively cold and
insipid.  I can only pronounce him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be a sensible man, well-bred,
well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable
heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Dashwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>cried Willoughby, <div class="bookquote">``you are now using me unkindly.  You
are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my
will.  But it will not do.  You shall find me as stubborn as you can be
artful.  I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel
Brandon; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has
found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
to buy my brown mare.  If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,
to be told, that I believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) character to be in other respects
irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return for an
acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the
privilege of disliking him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) as much as ever.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 11


<p/>Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters imagined when they first came
into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their
time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such
frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little
leisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.  When Marianne
was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir
John had been previously forming, were put into execution.  The private
balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and
accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.  In every
meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and
familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly
calculated to give increasing intimacy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) acquaintance with the
Dashwoods, to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of
Marianne, of marking his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) animated admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and of receiving,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
affection.

<p/>Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only wished
that it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture to
suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne.  But Marianne
abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;
and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves
illaudable, appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not merely an unnecessary effort, but a
disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.
Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an
illustration of their opinions.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was present she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had no eyes for any one else.  Every thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
did, was right.  Every thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) said, was clever.  If their evenings at
the park were concluded with cards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) cheated himself and all the rest
of the party to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusement
of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to
separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and
scarcely spoke a word to any body else.  Such conduct made them of
course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and
seemed hardly to provoke them.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) no inclination for checking this excessive display of them.  To her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and
ardent mind.

<p/>This was the season of happiness to Marianne.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart was devoted to
Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brought with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had thought it
possible before, by the charms which his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) society bestowed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
present home.

<p/>Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart was not so much at
ease, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) satisfaction in their amusements so pure.  They afforded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) no companion that could make amends for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had left behind,
nor that could teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to think of Norland with less regret than
ever.  Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) the
conversation she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker,
and from the first had regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) with a kindness which ensured her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) a
large share of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) discourse.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had already repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own history
to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equal to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) means of improvement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might have known very early in their
acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, and
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wife a few minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) died.  Lady Middleton
was more agreeable than her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother only in being more silent.  Elinor
needed little observation to perceive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reserve was a mere
calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.  Towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
husband and mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was the same as to them; and intimacy was
therefore neither to be looked for nor desired.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had nothing to say
one day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not said the day before.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) insipidity was
invariable, for even her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits were always the same; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
did not oppose the parties arranged by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband, provided every
thing were conducted in style and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) two eldest children attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might
have experienced in sitting at home;--and so little did her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) presence
add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation,
that they were sometimes only reminded of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) being amongst them by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
solicitude about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) troublesome boys.

<p/>In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) new acquaintance, did Elinor find
a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite
the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.
Willoughby was out of the question.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) admiration and regard, even
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sisterly regard, was all his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was a lover; his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might
have been more generally pleasing.  Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for
himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in
conversing with Elinor he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) found the greatest consolation for the
indifference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Elinor's compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) increased, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had reason to suspect
that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).
This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by
mutual consent, while the others were dancing.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eyes were fixed on
Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said, with a faint
smile, <div class="bookquote">``Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second
attachments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinions are all romantic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or rather, as I believe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) considers them impossible to exist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) does.  But how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) contrives it without reflecting on
the character of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own father, who had himself two wives, I know not.
A few years however will settle her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinions on the reasonable basis of
common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define
and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This will probably be the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``and yet there is
something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is
sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot agree with you there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor.  <div class="bookquote">``There are
inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all the
charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at
nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward
to as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) greatest possible advantage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short pause he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) resumed the conversation by saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does your sister make no distinction in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) objections against a
second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body?  Are those
who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the
inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be
equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) principles.
I only know that I never yet heard her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) admit any instance of a second
attachment's being pardonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``cannot hold; but a change, a total change of
sentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements
of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they
succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!  I
speak from experience.  I once knew a lady who in temper and mind
greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), but who
from an inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had said too much,
and by his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not
otherwise have entered Elinor's head.  The lady would probably have
passed without suspicion, had he (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) not convinced Miss Dashwood that what
concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) ought not to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) lips.  As it was, it required but
a slight effort of fancy to connect his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) emotion with the tender
recollection of past regard.  Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) place, would not have done so little.  The whole story would
have been speedily formed under her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) active imagination; and every thing
established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.



<p/>CHAPTER 12


<p/>As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the
latter communicated a piece of news to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, which in spite of
all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,
surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) by its extravagant testimony of both.  Marianne told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>),
with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a horse, one
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had bred himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) estate in Somersetshire, and which was
exactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering that it was
not in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were to alter
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) resolution in favour of this gift, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must buy another for the
servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable
to receive them, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had accepted the present without hesitation, and
told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister of it in raptures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) intends to send his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``and when it arrives we will ride every day.  You shall
share its use with me.  Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the
delight of a gallop on some of these downs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Most unwilling was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to awaken from such a dream of felicity to
comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for
some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) refused to submit to them.  As to an additional servant,
the expense would be a trifle; Mama she (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) was sure would never object to
it; and any horse would do for HIM; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) might always get one at the
park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.  Elinor then
ventured to doubt the propriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) receiving such a present from a
man so little, or at least so lately known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).  This was too much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) warmly, <div class="bookquote">``in supposing I know very
little of Willoughby.  I have not known him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) long indeed, but I am much
better acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), than I am with any other creature in the
world, except yourself and mama.  It is not time or opportunity that is
to determine intimacy;--it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be
insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven
days are more than enough for others.  I should hold myself guilty of
greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from
Willoughby.  Of John I know very little, though we have lived together
for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister's temper.  Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) the more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own opinion.  But by an appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) affection for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent
mother must draw on herself, if -LRB-as would probably be the case-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly
subdued; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) promised not to tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother to such imprudent
kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) next, that it must be declined.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) word; and when Willoughby called at the
cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) express her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) disappointment to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
present.  The reasons for this alteration were at the same time
related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) side
impossible.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) concern however was very apparent; and after
expressing it with earnestness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) added, in the same low voice,--<div class="bookquote">``But,
Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now.  I
shall keep it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton to
form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall
receive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the
sentence, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) manner of pronouncing it, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
sister by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) Christian name alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) instantly saw an intimacy so
decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between
them.  From that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) doubted not of their being engaged to each
other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), or
any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover
it by accident.

<p/>Margaret related something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) the next day, which placed this
matter in a still clearer light.  Willoughby had spent the preceding
evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour
with only him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,
which, with a most important face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) communicated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eldest
sister, when they were next by themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Elinor!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I have such a secret to tell you about
Marianne.  I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have said so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``almost every day since they first
met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I
believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) picture round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great
uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure they will be
married very soon, for he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has got a lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair of some great uncle of
HIS (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost sure it is, for I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) cut it off.  Last night after tea, when you and mama went out
of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could
be, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) seemed to be begging something of her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>), and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took
up her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) scissors and cut off a long lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) hair, for it was all
tumbled down her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) back; and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of
white paper; and put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pocket-book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not
withhold her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) credit; nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) disposed to it, for the circumstance
was in perfect unison with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had heard and seen herself.

<p/>Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister.  When Mrs. Jennings attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) one evening at the
park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particular
favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
Margaret answered by looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``I must not
tell, may I, Elinor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.
But the effort was painful.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was convinced that Margaret had fixed
on a person whose name she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not bear with composure to become a
standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.

<p/>Marianne felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) most sincerely; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did more harm than good
to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to
Margaret,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to
repeat them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never had any conjectures about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>replied Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``it was you
who told me of it yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly
pressed to say something more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Jennings.  <div class="bookquote">``What is the gentleman's name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well what it is; and I know
where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, we can guess where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is; at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own house at Norland to be
sure.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is the curate of the parish I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, THAT he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is not.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is of no profession at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne with great warmth, <div class="bookquote">``you know that all this is
an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in
existence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such
a man once, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name begins with an F.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this
moment, <div class="bookquote">``that it rained very hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton/Middleton</b></font>)</div>though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed the
interruption to proceed less from any attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), than from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as
delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband and mother.  The idea however started by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), was
immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion
mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of
rain by both of them.  Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked
Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of
different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.  But not so
easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a
very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a
brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not
be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders
on that head.  The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and
Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed
to be a tolerable judge, for he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had formed parties to visit them, at
least, twice every summer for the last ten years.  They contained a
noble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the
morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages
only to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a
complete party of pleasure.

<p/>To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,
considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the
last fortnight;--and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was
persuaded by Elinor to stay at home.



<p/>CHAPTER 13


<p/>Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from
what Elinor had expected.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was prepared to be wet through,
fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for
they did not go at all.

<p/>By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they
were to breakfast.  The morning was rather favourable, though it had
rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,
and the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high spirits and
good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the
greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.

<p/>While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.  Among the
rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) took it, looked at the
direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with Brandon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Sir John.

<p/>Nobody could tell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has had no bad news,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton/Middleton</b></font>)</div>said Lady Middleton.  <div class="bookquote">``It must be
something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my
breakfast table so suddenly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In about five minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No bad news, Colonel, I hope;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
entered the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None at all, ma'am, I thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it from Avignon?  I hope it is not to say that your sister is
worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a
letter of business?  Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear
the truth of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton/Middleton</b></font>)</div>said Lady Middleton, <div class="bookquote">``recollect what you are saying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton/Middleton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) daughter's reproof.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, it is not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom do you mean, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), colouring a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you know who I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am particularly sorry, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), addressing Lady Middleton,
<div class="bookquote">``that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which
requires my immediate attendance in town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton/Middleton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In town!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jennings.  <div class="bookquote">``What can you have to do in town at
this time of year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My own loss is great,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``in being obliged to leave so
agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence
is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>What a blow upon them all was this!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said
Marianne, eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``will it not be sufficient?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Sir John.--<div class="bookquote">``It shall not be put off when we are so
near it.  You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it is not in my power to
delay my journey for one day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you would but let us know what your business is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Jennings, <div class="bookquote">``we might see whether it could be put off or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not be six hours later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>said Willoughby, <div class="bookquote">``if you were to
defer your journey till our return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot afford to lose ONE hour.'' (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``There
are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.  Brandon is one of
them.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this
trick for getting out of it.  I would lay fifty guineas the letter was
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>replied Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of
old,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Sir John, <div class="bookquote">``when once you are determined on anything.  But,
however, I hope you will think better of it.  Consider, here are the
two Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked
up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Colonel Brandon again repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) sorrow at being the cause of
disappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be
unavoidable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, when will you come back again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope we shall see you at Barton,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>added her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) ladyship, <div class="bookquote">``as soon as
you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to
Whitwell till you return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very obliging.  But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in
my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitwell</b></font>) must and shall come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Sir John.  <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitwell</b></font>) is not here
by the end of the week, I shall go after him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitwell</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, so do, Sir John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jennings, <div class="bookquote">``and then perhaps you may
find out what his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitwell</b></font>) business is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not want to pry into other men's concerns.  I suppose it is
something he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitwell</b></font>) is ashamed of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>Colonel Brandon's horses were announced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not go to town on horseback, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>added Sir John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Only to Honiton.  I shall then go post.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey.  But you
had better change your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you it is not in my power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) then took leave of the whole party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this
winter, Miss Dashwood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid, none at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>To Marianne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) merely bowed and said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come Colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, <div class="bookquote">``before you go, do let us know what
you are going about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.

<p/>The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto
restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and
again how provoking it was to be so disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can guess what his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) business is, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings
exultingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said almost every body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who is Miss Williams?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>asked Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have
heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) before.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a
very near relation.  We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the
young ladies.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) voice a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) said to Elinor,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) natural daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; and as like him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) can stare.  I dare say the Colonel
will leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>When Sir John returned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) joined most heartily in the general regret
on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as
they were all got together, they must do something by way of being
happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although
happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a
tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country.  The
carriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never
looked happier than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) got into it.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) drove through the park
very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of them
was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the return
of all the rest.  They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said
only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others
went on the downs.

<p/>It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that
every body should be extremely merry all day long.  Some more of the
Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly
twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.
Willoughby took his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.
Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not been long
seated, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) leant behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) and Willoughby, and said to
Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, <div class="bookquote">``I have found you out in
spite of all your tricks.  I know where you spent the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, <div class="bookquote">``Where, pray?'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did not you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>said Willoughby, <div class="bookquote">``that we had been out in my
curricle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined
to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house, Miss
Marianne.  It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,
I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when
I was there six years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne turned away in great confusion.  Mrs. Jennings laughed
heartily; and Elinor found that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) resolution to know where they
had been, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had actually made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own woman enquire of Mr.
Willoughby's groom; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had by that method been informed that
they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in
walking about the garden and going all over the house.

<p/>Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely
that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house
while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest
acquaintance.

<p/>As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) about it;
and great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) surprise when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found that every circumstance
related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) for doubting it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we
did not see the house?  Is not it what you have often wished to do
yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with
no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew
that house; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) went in an open carriage, it was impossible to
have any other companion.  I never spent a pleasanter morning in my
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``that the pleasantness of an employment
does not always evince its propriety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if
there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been
sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting
wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very
impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of
your own conduct?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of
impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.
I value not her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) censure any more than I should do her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) commendation.  I
am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.
Smith's grounds, or in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) house.  They will one day be Mr.
Willoughby's, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be
justified in what you have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);
and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sister again, and said with great good humour, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS
rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted
particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure
you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice
comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would
be delightful.  It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.  On
one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a
beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church
and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so
often admired.  I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be
more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--a
couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the
pleasantest summer-rooms in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Could Elinor have listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) without interruption from the others,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have described every room in the house with equal delight.



<p/>CHAPTER 14


<p/>The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the
wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was a great
wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all
the comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wondered, with
little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must
be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could
have befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), with a fixed determination that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should not escape
them all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I could see it in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) face.  Poor man!  I am afraid his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) circumstances
may be bad.  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two
thousand a year, and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) brother left everything sadly involved.  I do
think he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can
it be?  I wonder whether it is so.  I would give anything to know the
truth of it.  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare
say it is, because he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) looked so conscious when I mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>).  May be
she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a
notion she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is always rather sickly.  I would lay any wager it is about
Miss Williams.  It is not so very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should be distressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
circumstances NOW, for he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is a very prudent man, and to be sure must
have cleared the estate by this time.  I wonder what it can be!  May be
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) over.  His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) setting
off in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) out of all
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/>So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) opinion varying with every
fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.
Elinor, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel
Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) going so suddenly away,
which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) feeling; for besides that the
circumstance did not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) opinion justify such lasting amazement or
variety of speculation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was
engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister and Willoughby on
the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them
all.  As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange
and more incompatible with the disposition of both.  Why they should
not openly acknowledge to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother and herself, what their constant
behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not
imagine.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in
their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason
to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) rich.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) estate had been rated by Sir John at about
six or seven hundred a year; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) lived at an expense to which that
income could hardly be equal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had himself often complained of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them
relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,
she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their
general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mind
of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
making any inquiry of Marianne.

<p/>Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than
Willoughby's behaviour.  To Marianne it had all the distinguishing
tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the
family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The
cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) home; many more
of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general
engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest
of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
favourite pointer at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feet.

<p/>One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the
country, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of
attachment to the objects around him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening
to mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) design of improving the cottage in the spring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) warmly
opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as
perfect with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) exclaimed--<div class="bookquote">``Improve this dear cottage!  No. THAT I will
never consent to.  Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch
to its size, if my feelings are regarded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be alarmed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Miss Dashwood, <div class="bookquote">``nothing of the kind will be
done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am heartily glad of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) cried.  <div class="bookquote">``May she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) always be poor, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
can employ her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) riches no better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I would not
sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one
whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.  Depend upon it
that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in
the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it
in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really so attached to this
place as to see no defect in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">``To me it is faultless.  Nay, more, I consider it as
the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I
rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in
the exact plan of this cottage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Combe</b></font>) in the same eager tone, <div class="bookquote">``with all and every thing
belonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it,
should the least variation be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under
such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at
Barton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I flatter myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``that even under the disadvantage
of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your
own house as faultless as you now do this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There certainly are circumstances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>said Willoughby, <div class="bookquote">``which might
greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of
my affection, which no other can possibly share.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were
fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How often did I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``when I was at Allenham this time
twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited!  I never passed within
view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one
should live in it.  How little did I then think that the very first
news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,
would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate
satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of
prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account
for.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in a lowered
voice.  Then continuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) former tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``And yet this house
you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it of its simplicity by
imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance
first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by
us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,
and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has
hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort
than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world
could possibly afford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood again assured him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) that no alteration of the kind should
be attempted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a good woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) warmly replied.  <div class="bookquote">``Your promise makes me
easy.  Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy.  Tell me
that not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever
find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will
always consider me with the kindness which has made everything
belonging to you so dear to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/>The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during the
whole of the evening declared at once his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) affection and happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was
leaving them.  <div class="bookquote">``I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must
walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) engaged to be with them by four o'clock.



<p/>CHAPTER 15


<p/>Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and
two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) daughters went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>); but Marianne excused herself from
being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the
night before of calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) while they were absent, was perfectly
satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) remaining at home.

<p/>On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle and
servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) conjecture had been just.  So far it was all as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had foreseen;
but on entering the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) beheld what no foresight had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
to expect.  They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came
hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
handkerchief at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.
Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning against
the mantel-piece with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) back towards them.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) turned round on their
coming in, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) countenance shewed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) strongly partook of the
emotion which over-powered Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is anything the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Dashwood as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
entered--<div class="bookquote">``is she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced
smile presently added, <div class="bookquote">``It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for I
am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Disappointment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.  Mrs. Smith has
this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent
cousin, by sending me on business to London.  I have just received my
dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of
exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To London!--and are you going this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
business will not detain you from us long I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) coloured as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, but I have no idea of
returning into Devonshire immediately.  My visits to Mrs. Smith are
never repeated within the twelvemonth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only house in the
neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?  For shame, Willoughby, can
you wait for an invitation here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) colour increased; and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) eyes fixed on the ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) only
replied, <div class="bookquote">``You are too good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.  Elinor felt equal
amazement.  For a few moments every one was silent.  Mrs. Dashwood
first spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you
will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here
immediately, because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing
to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question
your judgment than to doubt your inclination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My engagements at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>replied Willoughby, confusedly, <div class="bookquote">``are of
such a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself'' (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and another
pause succeeded.  This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faint
smile, <div class="bookquote">``It is folly to linger in this manner.  I will not torment
myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is
impossible for me now to enjoy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) then hastily took leave of them all and left the room.  They saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
step into his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the
parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this
sudden departure occasioned.

<p/>Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought of
what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.  Willoughby's behaviour
in taking leave of them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) embarrassment, and affectation of
cheerfulness, and, above all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) unwillingness to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's
invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,
greatly disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).  One moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feared that no serious design
had ever been formed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) side; and the next that some unfortunate
quarrel had taken place between him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister;--the distress in
which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could
most reasonably account for, though when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) considered what Marianne's
love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.

<p/>But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's
affliction was indubitable; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thought with the tenderest
compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability
not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a
duty.

<p/>In about half an hour her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother returned, and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes were
red, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) countenance was not uncheerful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sat down to work, <div class="bookquote">``and with how heavy a heart does he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) travel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work
of a moment.  And last night he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was with us so happy, so cheerful, so
affectionate?  And now, after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without
intending to return!--Something more than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) owned to us must have
happened.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) did not speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) did not behave like himself.  YOU must
have seen the difference as well as I.  What can it be?  Can they have
quarrelled?  Why else should he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) have shewn such unwillingness to accept
your invitation here?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not inclination that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see
THAT.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had not the power of accepting it.  I have thought it all
over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at
first seemed strange to me as well as to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you, indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but
you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy YOU,
I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am
persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) regard for Marianne, disapproves
of it, -LRB-perhaps because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has other views for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),-RRB- and on that
account is eager to get him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away;--and that the business which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sends him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
This is what I believe to have happened.  He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is, moreover, aware that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) DOES disapprove the connection, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dares not therefore at present
confess to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) engagement with Marianne, and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feels himself
obliged, from his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dependent situation, to give into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) schemes, and
absent himself from Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,
that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil,
unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair
as satisfactory at this.  And now, Elinor, what have you to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.
Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings!  You had rather
take evil upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for misery
for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the
latter.  You are resolved to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) blameable, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) took leave
of us with less affection than his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) usual behaviour has shewn.  And is
no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by
recent disappointment?  Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely
because they are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we
have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill
of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though
unavoidably secret for a while?  And, after all, what is it you suspect
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of something unpleasant is
the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed
in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of
the allowances which ought to be made for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and it is my wish to be
candid in my judgment of every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly have
very sufficient reasons for his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) conduct, and I will hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has.
But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at
once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at
its being practiced by him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), however, for departing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) character, where the
deviation is necessary.  But you really do admit the justice of what I
have said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) defence?--I am happy--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is acquitted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their engagement -LRB-if they
ARE engaged-RRB- from Mrs. Smith--and if that is the case, it must be
highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at
present.  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and
Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have
been reproaching them every day for incautiousness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want no proof of their affection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``but of their
engagement I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly satisfied of both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly.  Has
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last
fortnight, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) loved and considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) future
wife, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?
Have we not perfectly understood each other?  Has not my consent been
daily asked by his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) looks, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) manner, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) attentive and affectionate
respect?  My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How
could such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed that
Willoughby, persuaded as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) must be of your sister's love, should leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) perhaps for months, without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of
confidence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``that every circumstance except ONE is in
favour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of both
on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,
if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the
nature of the terms on which they are together.  Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) been acting a
part in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
really indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I cannot think that.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) must and does love her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) can leave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with such
indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this
matter as certain.  I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are
fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away.  If we
find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see them at the altar, you
would suppose they were going to be married.  Ungracious girl!  But I
require no such proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to
justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly
open and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.  It must
be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?  Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) not a man of
honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) side to
create alarm? can he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) be deceitful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not, I believe not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor.  <div class="bookquote">``I love Willoughby,
sincerely love him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>); and suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) integrity cannot be more
painful to yourself than to me.  It has been involuntary, and I will
not encourage it.  I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
manners this morning;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) did not speak like himself, and did not
return your kindness with any cordiality.  But all this may be
explained by such a situation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) affairs as you have supposed.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
had just parted from my sister, had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) in the greatest
affliction; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.
Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware
that by declining your invitation, by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was going away for
some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by
our family, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a
case, a plain and open avowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) difficulties would have been more
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) honour I think, as well as more consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) general
character;--but I will not raise objections against any one's conduct
on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,
or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be
suspected.  Though WE have not known him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) long, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is no stranger in
this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) disadvantage?
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,
it might have been odd that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) should leave us without acknowledging
everything to me at once: but this is not the case.  It is an
engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage
must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it
can be observed, may now be very advisable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then
at liberty to think over the representations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, to
acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.

<p/>They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) entered the
room and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) place at the table without saying a word.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes
were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tears were even then
restrained with difficulty.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) avoided the looks of them all, could
neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother's silently
pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand with tender compassion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) small degree of fortitude
was quite overcome, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) burst into tears and left the room.

<p/>This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
was without any power, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was without any desire of command
over herself.  The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby
overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in an instant; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) family were most
anxiously attentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) comfort, it was impossible for them, if they
spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feelings
connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER 16


<p/>Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) been able
to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
would have been ashamed to look her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) family in the face the next
morning, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not risen from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bed in more need of repose than
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lay down in it.  But the feelings which made such composure a
disgrace, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in no danger of incurring it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was awake the
whole night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wept the greatest part of it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) got up with a
headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;
giving pain every moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother and sisters, and forbidding all
attempt at consolation from either.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sensibility was potent enough!

<p/>When breakfast was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) walked out by herself, and wandered about
the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment
and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.

<p/>The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) played
over every favourite song that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been used to play to Willoughby,
every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at
the instrument gazing on every line of music that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had written out
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), till her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be
gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spent
whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) voice
often totally suspended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tears.  In books too, as well as in
music, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) courted the misery which a contrast between the past and
present was certain of giving.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) read nothing but what they had been
used to read together.

<p/>Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it
sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments,
to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) daily recurred, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) solitary walks and silent meditations,
still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.

<p/>No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy.  But Mrs.
Dashwood could find explanations whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wanted them, which at
least satisfied herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how very often Sir John fetches our
letters himself from the post, and carries them to it.  We have already
agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it
could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through
Sir John's hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) tried to find in it a
motive sufficient for their silence.  But there was one method so
direct, so simple, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion so eligible of knowing the real
state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could not help suggesting it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you not ask Marianne at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is or she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother, and so kind, so
indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence.  It would be
the natural result of your affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to be all
unreserve, and to you more especially.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not ask such a question for the world.  Supposing it possible
that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry
inflict!  At any rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never
deserve her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) confidence again, after forcing from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a confession of
what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.  I know
Marianne's heart: I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dearly loves me, and that I shall not
be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make
the revealment of it eligible.  I would not attempt to force the
confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty
would prevent the denial which her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wishes might direct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's
youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common
care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic
delicacy.

<p/>It was several days before Willoughby's name was mentioned before
Marianne by any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were
not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--but
one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of
Shakespeare, exclaimed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away
before we could get through it.  We will put it by, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) comes
again...But it may be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Months!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, with strong surprise.  <div class="bookquote">``No--nor many weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had said; but it gave Elinor
pleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of
confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) intentions.

<p/>One morning, about a week after his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) leaving the country, Marianne was
prevailed on to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters in their usual walk, instead of
wandering away by herself.  Hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had carefully avoided every
companion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) rambles.  If her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters intended to walk on the
downs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the
valley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be
found when the others set off.  But at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was secured by the
exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.
They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,
for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with
gaining one point, would not then attempt more.  Beyond the entrance of
the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild and
more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first
coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, they
stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed the
distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had
never happened to reach in any of their walks before.

<p/>Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one;
it was a man on horseback riding towards them.  In a few minutes they
could distinguish him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwards
Marianne rapturously exclaimed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); it is indeed;--I know it is!'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>--and was hastening to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when Elinor cried out,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is not Willoughby.
The person is not tall enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), and has not his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) air, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
coat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) horse.  I knew how soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) would come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) walked eagerly on as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from
particularity, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,
quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) pace and kept up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  They were soon within thirty
yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart sunk within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); and abruptly turning round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was hurrying back, when the voices
of both her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters were raised to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); a third, almost as well
known as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to stop, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was the only person in the world who could at that moment be
forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a
smile from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dispersed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tears to smile on HIM, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sister's happiness forgot for a time her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own disappointment.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) dismounted, and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) horse to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) servant, walked back with
them to Barton, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) was purposely coming to visit them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by
Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) reception of him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) than
even Elinor herself.  To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.  On
Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a
lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.  He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was confused,
seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither
rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) by
questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.  Marianne
saw and listened with increasing surprise.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) began almost to feel a
dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), by
carrying back her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a
contrast sufficiently striking to those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) brother elect.

<p/>After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries
of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) came directly from London.  No,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been in Devonshire a fortnight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fortnight!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) repeated, surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) being so long in the same
county with Elinor without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked rather distressed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) added, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been staying with
some friends near Plymouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been lately in Sussex?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was at Norland about a month ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how does dear, dear Norland look?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear Norland,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``probably looks much as it always
does at this time of the year.  The woods and walks thickly covered
with dead leaves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``with what transporting sensation have I formerly
seen them fall!  How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven
in showers about me by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season,
the air altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.  They
are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as
possible from the sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not every one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``who has your passion for dead
leaves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood.  But
SOMETIMES they are.'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--As she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sunk into a reverie for a
few moments;--but rousing herself again, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) attention to the prospect, <div class="bookquote">``here is Barton valley.  Look up
to it, and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!  Did you ever
see their equals?  To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and
plantations.  You may see the end of the house.  And there, beneath
that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a beautiful country,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``but these bottoms must be
dirty in winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>), smiling, <div class="bookquote">``among the rest of the objects before
me, I see a very dirty lane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) walked on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the Middletons pleasant
people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>answered Marianne; <div class="bookquote">``we could not be more unfortunately
situated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``how can you say so? How can you be so
unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards
us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you forgot, Marianne,
how many pleasant days we have owed to them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``nor how many painful moments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) attention to their
visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), by
talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting
from him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) occasional questions and remarks.  His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) coldness and reserve
mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) severely; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was vexed and half angry; but resolving to
regulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) by the past rather than the present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) ought to be treated from the family connection.



<p/>CHAPTER 17


<p/>Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>); for his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
coming to Barton was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) opinion, of all things the most natural.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) joy and expression of regard long outlived her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wonder.  He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) received
the kindest welcome from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); and shyness, coldness, reserve could not
stand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating
manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man could not very well be in love
with either of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters, without extending the passion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); and
Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon become more like
himself.  His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
interest in their welfare again became perceptible.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in
spirits, however; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) praised their house, admired its prospect, was
attentive, and kind; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in spirits.  The whole family
perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of
liberality in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, sat down to table indignant against all
selfish parents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>),
when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; <div class="bookquote">``are you still
to be a great orator in spite of yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than
inclination for a public life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to
satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no
affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find
it a difficult matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be distinguished; and have
every reason to hope I never shall.  Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced
into genius and eloquence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes are all moderate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe.  I wish as
well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body
else it must be in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strange that it would!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne.  <div class="bookquote">``What have wealth or grandeur
to do with happiness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandeur has but little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``but wealth has much to do with
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Elinor, for shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``money can only give happiness
where there is nothing else to give it.  Beyond a competence, it can
afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``we may come to the same point.  YOUR
competence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without
them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of
external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas are only more noble than
mine.  Come, what is your competence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor laughed.  <div class="bookquote">``TWO thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed how
it would end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne.
<div class="bookquote">``A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.  I am sure I am not
extravagant in my demands.  A proper establishment of servants, a
carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor smiled again, to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister describing so accurately their
future expenses at Combe Magna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hunters!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div>repeated Edward--<div class="bookquote">``but why must you have hunters?  Every body
does not hunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne coloured as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``But most people do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, <div class="bookquote">``that somebody
would give us all a large fortune apiece!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh that they would!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes sparkling with
animation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary
happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``in spite
of the insufficiency of wealth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``how happy I should be!  I wonder what I
should do with it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had no doubt on that point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Dashwood, <div class="bookquote">``if my children were all to be rich without my help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must begin your improvements on this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>observed Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``and
your difficulties will soon vanish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div>said
Edward, <div class="bookquote">``in such an event!  What a happy day for booksellers,
music-sellers, and print-shops!  You, Miss Dashwood, would give a
general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and as
for Marianne, I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) greatness of soul, there would not be music
enough in London to content her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,
Scott--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would buy them all over and over again: she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would buy up
every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would have every book that tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) how to admire an old
twisted tree.  Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very
saucy.  But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old
disputes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy or
gay, I love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking of
former times.  You are very right in supposing how my money would be
spent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly be employed
in improving my collection of music and books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the
authors or their heirs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who
wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever
be in love more than once in their life--your opinion on that point is
unchanged, I presume?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.  It is
not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) is not
at all altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) is only grown a little more grave than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``you need not reproach me.  You are not
very gay yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you think so!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), with a sigh.  <div class="bookquote">``But gaiety never
was a part of MY character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``I should hardly
call her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a lively girl--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) is very earnest, very eager in all she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
does--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
is not often really merry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``and yet I have always set her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
down as a lively girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``in a total misapprehension of character in some point or
other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or
stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the
deception originated.  Sometimes one is guided by what they say of
themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,
without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought it was right, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``to be guided
wholly by the opinion of other people.  I thought our judgments were
given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours.  This has
always been your doctrine, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of
the understanding.  All I have ever attempted to influence has been the
behaviour.  You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,
of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with
greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their
sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of
general civility,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div>said Edward to Elinor.  <div class="bookquote">``Do you gain no ground?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My judgment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``is all on your side of the question; but I
am afraid my practice is much more on your sister's.  I never wish to
offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I
am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.  I have frequently thought
that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I
am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own worth too well for false shame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div>replied Edward.
<div class="bookquote">``Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or
other.  If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy
and graceful, I should not be shy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you would still be reserved,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``and that is worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Edward started--<div class="bookquote">``Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), colouring.  <div class="bookquote">``Reserved!--how, in
what manner?  What am I to tell you?  What can you suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor looked surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) emotion; but trying to laugh off the
subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Do not you know my sister well enough to
understand what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) means?  Do not you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) calls every one
reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) admires as
rapturously as herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Edward made no answer.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
in their fullest extent--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sat for some time silent and dull.



<p/>CHAPTER 18


<p/>Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) friend.  His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
visit afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) but a very partial satisfaction, while his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own
enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was
unhappy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished it were equally evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) still distinguished
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) by the same affection which once she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had felt no doubt of
inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) preference seemed very
uncertain; and the reservedness of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) contradicted
one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning
before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to
promote their happiness as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could, soon left them to
themselves.  But before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was half way upstairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heard the parlour
door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself
come out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going into the village to see my horses,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as you are
not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>***

<p/>Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding
country; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) walk to the village, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had seen many parts of the
valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situation
than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had
exceedingly pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).  This was a subject which ensured Marianne's
attention, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was beginning to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own admiration of
these scenes, and to question him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) more minutely on the objects that had
particularly struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), when Edward interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) by saying, <div class="bookquote">``You
must not enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge in the
picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste
if we come to particulars.  I shall call hills steep, which ought to be
bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and
rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be
indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.  You must be
satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give.  I call it a
very fine country--the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine
timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich meadows
and several neat farm houses scattered here and there.  It exactly
answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with
utility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admire
it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey
moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.  I know nothing of
the picturesque.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it is but too true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne; <div class="bookquote">``but why should you
boast of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``that to avoid one kind of affectation,
Edward here falls into another.  Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) believes many people
pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really
feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affects greater
indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
possesses.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is fastidious and will have an affectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``that admiration of landscape scenery
is become a mere jargon.  Every body pretends to feel and tries to
describe with the taste and elegance of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) who first defined what
picturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I
have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to
describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and
meaning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am convinced,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div>said Edward, <div class="bookquote">``that you really feel all the delight in
a fine prospect which you profess to feel.  But, in return, your sister
must allow me to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,
but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked, twisted,
blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and
flourishing.  I do not like ruined, tattered cottages.  I am not fond
of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a
snug farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy, happy villages
please me better than the finest banditti in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sister.  Elinor only laughed.

<p/>The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained
thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) attention.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was sitting by Edward, and in taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tea from Mrs. Dashwood,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand passed so directly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), as to make a ring, with a plait
of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) cried.  <div class="bookquote">``Is that
Fanny's hair? I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) promising to give you some.  But I should
have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hair had been darker.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) really felt--but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw
how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had pained Edward, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own vexation at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) want of thought
could not be surpassed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) coloured very deeply, and giving a
momentary glance at Elinor, replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes; it is my sister's hair.  The
setting always casts a different shade on it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor had met his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eye, and looked conscious likewise.  That the hair
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;
the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne
considered as a free gift from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, Elinor was conscious must
have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and
affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of
something else, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) internally resolved henceforward to catch every
opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all
doubt, that it was exactly the shade of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own.

<p/>Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of
mind still more settled.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was particularly grave the whole morning.
Marianne severely censured herself for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had said; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own
forgiveness might have been more speedy, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) known how little
offence it had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.
Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the
cottage, came to take a survey of the guest.  With the assistance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name
of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery
against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of their
acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately
sprung.  But, as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only learned, from some very significant
looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions,
extended.

<p/>Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to
dine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.
On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor,
towards whose amusement he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) felt himself bound to contribute, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) wished
to engage them for both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You MUST drink tea with us to night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for we shall be quite
alone--and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a
large party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  <div class="bookquote">``And who knows but you may raise
a dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">``And that will tempt YOU, Miss Marianne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A dance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne.  <div class="bookquote">``Impossible! Who is to dance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.--What!
you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be
nameless is gone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish with all my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Sir John, <div class="bookquote">``that Willoughby were among
us again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward.  <div class="bookquote">``And who
is Willoughby?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
was sitting.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) a brief reply.  Marianne's countenance was more
communicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning
of others, but such of Marianne's expressions as had puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
before; and when their visitors left them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) went immediately round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and said, in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I have been guessing.  Shall I tell you
my guess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not help smiling at
the quiet archness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) manner, and after a moment's silence, said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come I hope...I am sure
you will like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), rather astonished at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) earnestness
and warmth; for had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing
between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) would not have ventured to
mention it.



<p/>CHAPTER 19


<p/>Edward remained a week at the cottage; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was earnestly pressed by Mrs.
Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) were bent only on
self-mortification, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed resolved to be gone when his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) enjoyment
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) friends was at the height.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spirits, during the last two
or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
grew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of
going away without a sigh--declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) time to be wholly
disengaged--even doubted to what place he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should go when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) left
them--but still, go he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must.  Never had any week passed so quickly--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
could hardly believe it to be gone.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said so repeatedly; other
things he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said too, which marked the turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) feelings and gave the
lie to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) actions.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had no pleasure at Norland; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) detested being
in town; but either to Norland or London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must go.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) valued their
kindness beyond any thing, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) greatest happiness was in being with
them.  Yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of their
wishes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own, and without any restraint on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) time.

<p/>Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mother's account; and it was happy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had a mother whose
character was so imperfectly known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), as to be the general excuse
for every thing strange on the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) son.  Disappointed, however,
and vexed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was, and sometimes displeased with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) uncertain
behaviour to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was very well disposed on the whole to regard
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,
which had been rather more painfully extorted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for
Willoughby's service, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) want of spirits, of openness,
and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) want of
independence, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition
and designs.  The shortness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) visit, the steadiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) purpose
in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same
inevitable necessity of temporizing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) mother.  The old
well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child,
was the cause of all.  She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have been glad to know when these
difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs.
Ferrars would be reformed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son be at liberty to be happy.  But
from such vain wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) confidence in Edward's affection, to the remembrance of every
mark of regard in look or word which fell from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) while at Barton, and
above all to that flattering proof of it which he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) constantly wore round
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the
last morning, <div class="bookquote">``you would be a happier man if you had any profession to
engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions.  Some
inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you would
not be able to give them so much of your time.  But -LRB-with a smile-RRB- you
would be materially benefited in one particular at least--you would
know where to go when you left them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``that I have long thought on this point,
as you think now.  It has been, and is, and probably will always be a
heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage
me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like
independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my
friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being.  We never
could agree in our choice of a profession.  I always preferred the
church, as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.
They recommended the army.  That was a great deal too smart for me.
The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had
chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first
circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had no
inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which
my family approved.  As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I
was too old when the subject was first started to enter it--and, at
length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all,
as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as
with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous
and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so
earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been
properly idle ever since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood,
<div class="bookquote">``since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons will
be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades
as Columella's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will be brought up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in a serious accent, <div class="bookquote">``to be as
unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling, in action, in condition, in
every thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,
Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike
yourself must be happy.  But remember that the pain of parting from
friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their
education or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want nothing but
patience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope.  Your
mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so
anxious for; it is her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) duty, and it will, it must ere long become her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.
How much may not a few months do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div>replied Edward, <div class="bookquote">``that I may defy many months to produce any
good to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div><p/>This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to
Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which
shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's
feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.
But as it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself
from appearing to suffer more than what all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) family suffered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
going away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by
Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sorrow, by
seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means were as different
as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.

<p/>Elinor sat down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) drawing-table as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was out of the
house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor
avoided the mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) name, appeared to interest herself almost as
much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this
conduct, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own grief, it was at least prevented
from unnecessary increase, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother and sisters were spared much
solicitude on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) account.

<p/>Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own, appeared no
more meritorious to Marianne, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own had seemed faulty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).
The business of self-command she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) settled very easily;--with strong
affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.
That her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's affections WERE calm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dared not deny, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) gave a
very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in
spite of this mortifying conviction.

<p/>Without shutting herself up from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) family, or leaving the house in
determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to
indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) leisure enough
to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possible
variety which the different state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits at different times
could produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.
There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,
conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was
produced.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind was inevitably at liberty; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts could not
be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so
interesting, must be before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), must force her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) attention, and engross
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) memory, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reflection, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fancy.

<p/>From a reverie of this kind, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) drawing-table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
roused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of
company.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the little
gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes to the window, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw a large party walking up to the
door.  Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,
but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown
to her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John
perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) left the rest of the party to the ceremony of
knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to open
the casement to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>), though the space was so short between the
door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at one
without being heard at the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we have brought you some strangers.  How do you like
them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! they will hear you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.  Charlotte is very
pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) if you look this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>As Elinor was certain of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in a couple of minutes, without
taking that liberty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) begged to be excused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Marianne? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) run away because we are come? I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
instrument is open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is walking, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to
wait till the door was opened before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) told HER story.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) came
hallooing to the window, <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs.
Dashwood do?  And where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you will be
glad of a little company to sit with you.  I have brought my other son
and daughter to see you.  Only think of their coming so suddenly!  I
thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,
but it never entered my head that it could be them.  I thought of
nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so
I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel
Brandon come back again'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Elinor was obliged to turn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) story, to
receive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two
strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same
time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings
continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) story as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) walked through the passage into the parlour,
attended by Sir John.

<p/>Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally
unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) in every respect.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) was short and plump, had a very
pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could
possibly be.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) manners were by no means so elegant as her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) sister's,
but they were much more prepossessing.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) came in with a smile,
smiled all the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) visit, except when she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) laughed, and smiled
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) went away.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) husband was a grave looking young man of five
or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife,
but of less willingness to please or be pleased.  He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) entered the room
with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without
speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their
apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read
it as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) staid.

<p/>Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a
turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so
charming!  Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last!
I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am! -LRB-turning to Mrs.
Dashwood-RRB- but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister, how
delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!
Should not you, Mr. Palmer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palmer made her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) no answer, and did not even raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) eyes from the
newspaper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palmer does not hear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), laughing; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) never does
sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had never been used to
find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking with
surprise at them both.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could, and
continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing
their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer
laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every
body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an
agreeable surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may believe how glad we all were to see them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>added Mrs.
Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on
different sides of the room; <div class="bookquote">``but, however, I can't help wishing they
had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,
for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for
you know -LRB-nodding significantly and pointing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) daughter-RRB- it was
wrong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) situation.  I wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to stay at home and rest this
morning, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would come with us; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) longed so much to see you all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) any harm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) expects to be confined in February,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Jennings.

<p/>Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and
therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in
the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, none at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) replied, and read on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here comes Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Sir John.  <div class="bookquote">``Now, Palmer, you shall see a
monstrous pretty girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and
ushered her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
appeared, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so
heartily at the question, as to show she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) understood it.  Mr. Palmer
looked up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) entering the room, stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) some minutes, and
then returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught by
the drawings which hung round the room.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) got up to examine them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!  Do but
look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look
at them for ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then sitting down again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) very soon forgot
that there were any such things in the room.

<p/>When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down
the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love, have you been asleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wife, laughing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) no answer; and only observed, after again examining the
room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) then made his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) bow, and departed with the rest.

<p/>Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at
the park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener
than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own account;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no curiosity to
see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of
pleasure from them in any other way.  They attempted, therefore,
likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not
likely to be good.  But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage
should be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) did not press their mother, pressed them.  Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.
Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a
family party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should they ask us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.
<div class="bookquote">``The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very
hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying
either with them, or with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``by
these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a
few weeks ago.  The alteration is not in them, if their parties are
grown tedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 20


<p/>As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next
day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as
good humoured and merry as before.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) took them all most
affectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to see you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), seating herself between Elinor and
Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,
which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must
go, for the Westons come to us next week you know.  It was quite a
sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the
carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I
would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to Barton.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) is so droll! He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) never tells me any
thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again
in town very soon, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not go to town!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be quite
disappointed if you do not.  I could get the nicest house in world for
you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square.  You must come, indeed.  I
am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am
confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div><p/>They thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); but were obliged to resist all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) entreaties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Palmer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) husband, who just then entered
the room--<div class="bookquote">``you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to
town this winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began
complaining of the weather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How horrid all this is!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">``Such weather makes every thing and
every body disgusting.  Dullness is as much produced within doors as
without, by rain.  It makes one detest all one's acquaintance.  What
the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
house?  How few people know what comfort is!  Sir John is as stupid as
the weather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The rest of the company soon dropt in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid, Miss Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Sir John, <div class="bookquote">``you have not been able to
take your usual walk to Allenham today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't be so sly before us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Palmer; <div class="bookquote">``for we know all
about it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think
he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is extremely handsome.  We do not live a great way from him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) in the
country, you know.  Not above ten miles, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much nearer thirty,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well! there is not much difference.  I never was at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) house; but
they say it is a sweet pretty place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palmer</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palmer.

<p/>Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) countenance betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
interest in what was said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it very ugly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Palmer--<div class="bookquote">``then it must be some other
place that is so pretty I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div><p/>When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with regret
that they were only eight all together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) lady, <div class="bookquote">``it is very provoking that we should be
so few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,
that it could not be done?  They dined with us last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You and I, Sir John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, <div class="bookquote">``should not stand upon such
ceremony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you would be very ill-bred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palmer</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Palmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love you contradict every body,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wife with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) usual
laugh.  <div class="bookquote">``Do you know that you are quite rude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother
ill-bred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, you may abuse me as you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the good-natured old lady,
<div class="bookquote">``you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) back again.
So there I have the whip hand of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband could not get rid
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); and exultingly said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did not care how cross he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),
as they must live together.  It was impossible for any one to be more
thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.
Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
husband gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) no pain; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) scolded or abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was
highly diverted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palmer is so droll!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), in a whisper, to Elinor.  <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) is
always out of humour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) credit
for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
wished to appear.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) temper might perhaps be a little soured by
finding, like many others of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) sex, that through some unaccountable
bias in favour of beauty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was the husband of a very silly
woman,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any
sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.-- It was rather a wish of
distinction, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) believed, which produced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contemptuous treatment of
every body, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) general abuse of every thing before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  It was
the desire of appearing superior to other people.  The motive was too
common to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by
establishing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach
any one to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) except his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``I have
got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.  Will you come and
spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas?  Now, pray do,--and come
while the Westons are with us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!
It will be quite delightful!--My love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div>applying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``don't
you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) replied, with a sneer--<div class="bookquote">``I came into Devonshire with no
other view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There now,'' (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>--said his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lady, <div class="bookquote">``you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you
cannot refuse to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>They both eagerly and resolutely declined her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) invitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you will like it of all
things.  The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.
You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay
now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing
against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I
never saw before, it is quite charming!  But, poor fellow! it is very
fatiguing to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)! for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is forced to make every body like him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could hardly keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) countenance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) assented to the
hardship of such an obligation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How charming it will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is in
Parliament!--won't it? How I shall laugh!  It will be so ridiculous to
see all his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) letters directed to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) with an M.P.--But do you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
says, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will never frank for me?  He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) declares he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) won't.  Don't you,
Mr. Palmer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Palmer took no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) cannot bear writing, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) continued--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) says it is quite
shocking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I never said any thing so irrational.  Don't palm all
your abuses of languages upon me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There now; you see how droll he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) is.  This is always the way with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)!
Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) won't speak to me for half a day together, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
comes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,
by asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) seems very agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) is so pleasant;
and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can
tell you, and you can't think how disappointed he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) will be if you don't
come to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was again obliged to decline her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) invitation; and by changing the
subject, put a stop to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) entreaties.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought it probable that as
they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some
more particular account of Willoughby's general character, than could
be gathered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) merits as
might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) began by
inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether
they were intimately acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, yes; I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) extremely well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Palmer;--<div class="bookquote">``Not
that I ever spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), indeed; but I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) for ever in town.
Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) was
at Allenham.  Mama saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) here once before;--but I was with my uncle
at Weymouth.  However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we
should never have been in the country together.  He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is very little at
Combe, I believe; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) were ever so much there, I do not think Mr.
Palmer would visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) is in the opposition, you know, and
besides it is such a way off.  I know why you inquire about him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), very
well; your sister is to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>).  I am monstrous glad of it, for then
I shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) for a neighbour you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``you know much more of the matter than
I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks
of.  I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mrs. Palmer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in
Bond-street, just before we left town, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) told me of it directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell you of it!  Surely
you must be mistaken.  To give such intelligence to a person who could
not be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should
expect Colonel Brandon to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how
it happened.  When we met him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) turned back and walked with us; and
so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and
another, and I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), `So, Colonel, there is a new family come to
Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty,
and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe
Magna.  Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have been
in Devonshire so lately.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did the Colonel say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did not say much; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) knew it to be true, so
from that moment I set it down as certain.  It will be quite
delightful, I declare!  When is it to take place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) did nothing but
say fine things of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am flattered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) commendation.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) seems an excellent man; and I
think him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) uncommonly pleasing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) should
be so grave and so dull.  Mama says HE (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was in love with your sister
too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) hardly
ever falls in love with any body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are
acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all
think him (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) extremely agreeable I assure you.  Nobody is more liked than
Mr. Willoughby wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) goes, and so you may tell your sister.  She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
is a monstrous lucky girl to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), upon my honour; not but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
is much more lucky in getting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is so very handsome and
agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).  However, I don't
think her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think
you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,
though we could not get him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to own it last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby was not very material;
but any testimony in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) favour, however small, was pleasing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>continued
Charlotte.--<div class="bookquote">``And now I hope we shall always be great friends.  You
can't think how much I longed to see you!  It is so delightful that you
should live at the cottage!  Nothing can be like it, to be sure!  And I
am so glad your sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will be
a great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place, by all accounts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.-- He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was a
particular friend of Sir John's. I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) added in a low voice,
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would have been very glad to have had me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could.  Sir John
and Lady Middleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think the
match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to
the Colonel, and we should have been married immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's proposal to your mother
before it was made?  Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) never owned his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) affection to yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would have
liked it of all things.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had not seen me then above twice, for it
was before I left school.  However, I am much happier as I am.  Mr.
Palmer is the kind of man I like.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Palmers</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 21


<p/>The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at
Barton were again left to entertain each other.  But this did not last
long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) head, had
hardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, at
Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange
unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir
John's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause of society,
procured her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) some other new acquaintance to see and observe.

<p/>In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies,
whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to
the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.
Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an
invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the
return of Sir John, by hearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was very soon to receive a
visit from two girls whom she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had never seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) life, and of whose
elegance,--whose tolerable gentility even, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could have no proof; for
the assurances of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) husband and mother on that subject went for
nothing at all.  Their being her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) relations too made it so much the
worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore
unfortunately founded, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) daughter not to care about
their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put
up with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to prevent
their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with
all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merely
giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times
every day.

<p/>The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel or
unfashionable.  Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,
they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,
and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady
Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had
been an hour at the Park.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) declared them to be very agreeable girls
indeed, which for her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.  Sir John's
confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss
Steeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls
in the world.  From such commendation as this, however, there was not
much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the
world were to be met with in every part of England, under every
possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding.  Sir John
wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It was painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) even to
keep a third cousin to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do come now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``pray come--you must come--I declare you shall
come--You can't think how you will like them.  Lucy is monstrous
pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable!  The children are all
hanging about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) already, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was an old acquaintance.  And they
both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that
you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them
it is all very true, and a great deal more.  You will be delighted with
them I am sure.  They have brought the whole coach full of playthings
for the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?  Why they
are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.  YOU are my cousins, and
they are my wife's, so you must be related.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Sir John could not prevail.  He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) could only obtain a promise of
their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in
amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their
attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had been already boasting of the
Miss Steeles to them.

<p/>When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to
these young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the
eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible
face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two or
three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) features
were pretty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air,
which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) person.-- Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon
allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw with what
constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable
to Lady Middleton.  With her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) children they were in continual raptures,
extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their
whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate
demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of
whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) ladyship was doing, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) happened to be doing any thing,
or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.
Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond
mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children, the most
rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) demands
are exorbitant; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will swallow any thing; and the excessive
affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) offspring were
viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or
distrust.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent
encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) cousins submitted.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their
work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt
no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other
surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,
without claiming a share in what was passing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John is in such spirits today!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) taking Miss Steeles's
pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) is full of
monkey tricks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Steeles/Steeles</b></font>)</div><p/>And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently pinching one of the
same lady's fingers, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fondly observed, <div class="bookquote">``How playful William is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And here is my sweet little Annamaria,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added, tenderly caressing
a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last
two minutes; <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there
such a quiet little thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div><p/>But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship's
head dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from this
pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone
by any creature professedly noisy.  The mother's consternation was
excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and
every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which
affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little
sufferer.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) was seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) mother's lap, covered with kisses, her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>)
wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) knees to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) mouth stuffed with sugar plums by
the other.  With such a reward for her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) tears, the child was too wise to
cease crying.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) two
brothers for offering to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>), and all their united soothings were
ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of
similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been
successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly
proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of
screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that
it would not be rejected.-- She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was carried out of the room therefore
in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys
chose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay
behind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room
had not known for many hours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little creatures!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.
<div class="bookquote">``It might have been a very sad accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet I hardly know how,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``unless it had been under
totally different circumstances.  But this is the usual way of
heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy Steele.

<p/>Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not
feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the whole
task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with more
warmth than she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Sir John too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister man</b></font>)</div>cried the elder sister, <div class="bookquote">``what a charming man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sister man</b></font>)</div><p/>Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being only simple and just,
came in without any eclat.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) merely observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was perfectly
good humoured and friendly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what a charming little family they have!  I never saw such fine
children in my life.--I declare I quite doat upon them already, and
indeed I am always distractedly fond of children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should guess so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``from what I have
witnessed this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a notion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``you think the little Middletons rather
too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is
so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children
full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and
quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``that while I am at Barton Park, I never
think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss
Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now
said rather abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?
I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of
the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>added Miss Steele.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, who seemed
to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think every one MUST admire it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``who ever saw the
place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its
beauties as we do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I suppose you have not so
many in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast
addition always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, looking ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sister,
<div class="bookquote">``that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there an't.  I'm
sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how could
I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only
afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not
so many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies may not
care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them.
For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dress
smart and behave civil.  But I can't bear to see them dirty and nasty.
Now there's Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite a
beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) of
a morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quite
a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) married, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was so rich?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you, for I do not
perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.  But this I can say, that
if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever was a beau before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) married, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is one still for there is
not the smallest alteration in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men's being beaux--they have
something else to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord! Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``you can talk of nothing but
beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else.''
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>And then to turn the discourse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) began admiring the house and the
furniture.

<p/>This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.  The vulgar freedom and
folly of the eldest left her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) no recommendation, and as Elinor was not
blinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) want
of real elegance and artlessness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) left the house without any wish
of knowing them better.

<p/>Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well provided with
admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) family, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) fair
cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,
accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom
they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be
better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable
lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,
their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of
intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or two
together in the same room almost every day.  Sir John could do no more;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) opinion, to be intimate, and while his (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) continual schemes for their
meeting were effectual, he (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) had not a doubt of their being established
friends.

<p/>To do him (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) justice, he (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) did every thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) power to promote their
unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) knew
or supposed of his (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) cousins' situations in the most delicate
particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the
eldest of them wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) joy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's having been so lucky as
to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) came to Barton.

<p/>''`Twill be a fine thing to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) married so young to be sure,'' said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I hear he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome.  And I
hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have
a friend in the corner already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in
proclaiming his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) suspicions of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) regard for Edward, than he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been
with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) favourite joke of
the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since
Edward's visit, they had never dined together without his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) drinking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and
winks, as to excite general attention.  The letter F--had been likewise
invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless
jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had
been long established with Elinor.

<p/>The Miss Steeles, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) expected, had now all the benefit of these
jokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the
name of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently
expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) general inquisitiveness
into the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not sport long
with the curiosity which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) delighted to raise, for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had at least as
much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name is Ferrars,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), in a very audible whisper; <div class="bookquote">``but pray do
not tell it, for it's a great secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ferrars!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>repeated Miss Steele; <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)?
What! your sister-in-law's brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable
young man to be sure; I know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say so, Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, who generally made an amendment
to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sister's assertions.  <div class="bookquote">``Though we have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) once or twice
at my uncle's, it is rather too much to pretend to know him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise.  <div class="bookquote">``And who was this
uncle?  Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) live?  How came they acquainted?''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished very
much to have the subject continued, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not chuse to join in
it herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after
petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it.  The manner
in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) curiosity; for
it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion
of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
disadvantage.--But her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) curiosity was unavailing, for no farther notice
was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or even
openly mentioned by Sir John.



<p/>CHAPTER 22


<p/>Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like
impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of
taste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from
the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to
encourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on
their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself
which soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of
Lucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in conversation, or of
striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank
communication of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sentiments.

<p/>Lucy was naturally clever; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remarks were often just and amusing; and
as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) agreeable;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) powers had received no aid from education: she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was ignorant and
illiterate; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) deficiency of all mental improvement, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) want of
information in the most common particulars, could not be concealed from
Miss Dashwood, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) constant endeavour to appear to
advantage.  Elinor saw, and pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for, the neglect of abilities
which education might have rendered so respectable; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw, with
less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of
rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) attentions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
assiduities, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could have no
lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity
with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in
conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made
every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly
valueless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
one day, as they were walking together from the park to the
cottage--<div class="bookquote">``but pray, are you personally acquainted with your
sister-in-law's mother, Mrs. Ferrars?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) countenance
expressed it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>replied Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``I wonder at that, for I thought you must have
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) at Norland sometimes.  Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what
sort of a woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>returned Elinor, cautious of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) real opinion of Edward's
mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent
curiosity-- <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in such a
way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke; <div class="bookquote">``but perhaps
there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope you
will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be
impertinent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in
silence.  It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by
saying, with some hesitation,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.  I am sure I
would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person
whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours.  And I am sure I
should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be
very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable
situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.
I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry I do NOT,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, in great astonishment, <div class="bookquote">``if it could
be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).  But really I never
understood that you were at all connected with that family, and
therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it.  But
if I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised.  Mrs.
Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present--but the time MAY
come--how soon it will come must depend upon herself--when we may be
very intimately connected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) looked down as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) said this, amiably bashful, with only one side
glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) companion to observe its effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``what do you mean?  Are you acquainted
with Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not feel much
delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>replied Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) in my
life; but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes upon Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) eldest brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as
painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the
assertion attended it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,
unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) complexion varied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no
danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well be surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>continued Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``for to be sure you could
have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) never dropped the
smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always
meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so
by me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations know of it but
Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt
the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really
thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars
must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.  And I do not think
Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) knows I have trusted you,
because I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) has the highest opinion in the world of all your
family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) own sisters.'' (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) paused.

<p/>Elinor for a few moments remained silent.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) astonishment at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself
to speak, and to speak cautiously, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said, with calmness of manner,
which tolerably well concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) surprise and solicitude-- <div class="bookquote">``May I ask
if your engagement is of long standing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been engaged these four years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Four years!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that you were even acquainted till the
other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.  He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was under my
uncle's care, you know, a considerable while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your uncle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) talk of Mr. Pratt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which
increased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) increase of emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near
Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me
was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was
formed, though not till a year after he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had quitted as a pupil; but he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
was almost always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter
into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mother; but I was too young, and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) too well, to be so
prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) so well
as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to be sensible
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said; but after
a moment's reflection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) added, with revived security of Edward's
honour and love, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) companion's falsehood--<div class="bookquote">``Engaged to Mr. Edward
Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,
that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake
of person or name.  We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can mean no other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, smiling.  <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Edward Ferrars, the
eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your
sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow
that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who
all my happiness depends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, <div class="bookquote">``that I
should never have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even mention your name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; considering our situation, it was not strange.  Our first care has
been to keep the matter secret.-- You knew nothing of me, or my family,
and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name
to you; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always particularly afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister's
suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not mentioning it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) self-command did not
sink with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four years you have been engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with a firm voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait.  Poor
Edward!  It puts him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quite out of heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then taking a small miniature
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pocket, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``To prevent the possibility of mistake, be
so good as to look at this face.  It does not do him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) justice, to be
sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was
drew for.--I have had it above these three years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke; and when Elinor saw the
painting, whatever other doubts her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fear of a too hasty decision, or
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could have none of its being Edward's face.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) returned it almost
instantly, acknowledging the likeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never been able,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>continued Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) my picture in
return, which I am very much vexed at, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has been always so
anxious to get it!  But I am determined to set for it the very first
opportunity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite in the right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor calmly.  They then
proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully
keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to
us, not to have it reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother; for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never approve of it,
I dare say.  I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is an exceeding
proud woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly did not seek your confidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``but you do me
no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on.  Your
secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so
unnecessary a communication.  You must at least have felt that my being
acquainted with it could not add to its safety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover
something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest
part of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been saying; but Lucy's countenance suffered no
change.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``in telling you all this.  I have not known you long to be
sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by
description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as
if you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case, I really
thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular
inquiries about Edward's mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have
not a creature whose advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that
knows of it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has no judgment at all; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) does me a
great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
betraying me.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) does not know how to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tongue, as you must
perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world
t`other day, when Edward's name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
should out with it all.  You can't think how much I go through in my
mind from it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what I
have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.  Every thing in
such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) so seldom--we can hardly
meet above twice a-year.  I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite
broke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very
compassionate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>continued Lucy, after wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I think whether it
would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.''   (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked directly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) companion.  <div class="bookquote">``But then at
other times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I cannot bear the
thoughts of making him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) so miserable, as I know the very mention of such
a thing would do.  And on my own account too--so dear as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) is to me--I
don't think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise me to do in
such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you do yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, startled by the question; <div class="bookquote">``but I can give
you no advice under such circumstances.  Your own judgment must direct
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both
sides, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) mother must provide for him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sometime or other; but poor
Edward is so cast down by it!  Did you not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dreadful
low-spirited when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was at Barton?  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was so miserable when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) left
us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)

their names.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did not you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sadly out of spirits?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>repeated Lucy.

am afraid it is just the same with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) now; for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) writes in wretched
spirits.  I heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) just before I left Exeter;''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>taking a letter

written so well as usual.--He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was tired, I dare say, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had just
filled the sheet to me as full as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor saw that it WAS his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could doubt no longer.  This
picture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had allowed herself to believe, might have been
accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward's gift; but a
correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a
positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few
moments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was almost overcome--her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart sunk within her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feelings, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) success was speedy, and for the time complete.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Writing to each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, returning the letter into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
pocket, <div class="bookquote">``is the only comfort we have in such long separations.  Yes, I
have one other comfort in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) picture, but poor Edward has not even
THAT.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had but my picture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should be easy.  I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
a lock of my hair set in a ring when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was at Longstaple last, and
that was some comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, but not equal to a picture.
Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was
concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had ever felt
before.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was mortified, shocked, confounded.

<p/>Fortunately for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), they had now reached the cottage, and the
conversation could be continued no farther.  After sitting with them a
few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then
at liberty to think and be wretched.

<p/>CHAPTER 23


<p/>However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be,
it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on serious reflection to suspect it in the
present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of
inventing a falsehood of such a description.  What Lucy had asserted to
be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supported
as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and
contradicted by nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own wishes.  Their opportunity of
acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,
at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near Plymouth,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) melancholy state of mind, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dissatisfaction at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own prospects,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the
Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had
often surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>), the picture, the letter, the ring, formed
altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of
condemning him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality
could set aside, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ill-treatment of herself.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) resentment of such
behaviour, her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations,
soon arose.  Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>)?  Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
feigned a regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did not feel?  Was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) engagement to
Lucy an engagement of the heart?  No; whatever it might once have been,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not believe it such at present.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
own.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not be deceived in that.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, sisters, Fanny,
all had been conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) at Norland; it was not an
illusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own vanity.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) certainly loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).  What a softener
of the heart was this persuasion!  How much could it not tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to
forgive!  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at
Norland after he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) first felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be more than it
ought to be.  In that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could not be defended; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had injured
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), how much more had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) injured himself; if her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) case were pitiable,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was hopeless.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) imprudence had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) miserable for a while;
but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being
otherwise.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might in time regain tranquillity; but HE (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), what had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
to look forward to?  Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele;
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), were his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection for herself out of the question, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
integrity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a
wife like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--illiterate, artful, and selfish?

<p/>The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to every
thing but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding
years--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the
understanding, must have opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) defects of education,
while the same period of time, spent on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side in inferior society
and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of that simplicity
which might once have given an interesting character to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beauty.

<p/>If in the supposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) seeking to marry herself, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) difficulties
from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely
to be, when the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) engagement was undoubtedly inferior in
connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.  These
difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might not
press very hard upon his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) patience; but melancholy was the state of the
person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness,
could be felt as a relief!

<p/>As these considerations occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in painful succession, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wept
for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), more than for herself.  Supported by the conviction of having
done nothing to merit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) present unhappiness, and consoled by the
belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) esteem, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command
herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother
and sisters.  And so well was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) able to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own expectations,
that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) joined them at dinner only two hours after she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had first
suffered the extinction of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) dearest hopes, no one would have
supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning
in secret over obstacles which must divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for ever from the object
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the
perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt thoroughly
possessed, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expected to see in every carriage which drove
near their house.

<p/>The necessity of concealing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother and Marianne, what had been
entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to unceasing
exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor's distress.  On the contrary it
was a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), to be spared the communication of what would give
such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that
condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of
their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt
equal to support.

<p/>From their counsel, or their conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could receive
no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) distress,
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) self-command would neither receive encouragement from their
example nor from their praise.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was stronger alone, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own
good sense so well supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) firmness was as unshaken,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so
poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.

<p/>Much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had suffered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first conversation with Lucy on the
subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for
more reasons than one.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wanted to hear many particulars of their
engagement repeated again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wanted more clearly to understand what
Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
declaration of tender regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) particularly wanted to
convince Lucy, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) readiness to enter on the matter again, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
calmness in conversing on it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was no otherwise interested in
it than as a friend, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) very much feared her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) involuntary
agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least
doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) appeared very
probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) venturing to
trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so
confessedly and evidently important.  And even Sir John's joking
intelligence must have had some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor
remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by
Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it
natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was so, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) very
confidence was a proof.  What other reason for the disclosure of the
affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of
Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in future?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) rival's
intentions, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was firmly resolved to act by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) as every
principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own affection
for Edward and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as little as possible; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not deny
herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart was
unwounded.  And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could now have nothing more painful to hear on
the subject than had already been told, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not mistrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own
ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.

<p/>But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be
commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take
advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine
enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most
easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at
least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at
the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of
conversation.  Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady
Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for
a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.  They met for
the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,
or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.

<p/>One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording
Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at
the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they
would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was obliged to
attend the club at Exeter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) would otherwise be quite alone,
except her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother and the two Miss Steeles.  Elinor, who foresaw a
fairer opening for the point she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had in view, in such a party as this
was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil
and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) husband united
them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the
invitation; Margaret, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mother's permission, was equally
compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their
parties, was persuaded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother, who could not bear to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.

<p/>The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from
the frightful solitude which had threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>).  The insipidity of the
meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one
novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting
than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and
drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while
they remained there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was too well convinced of the impossibility of
engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the
removal of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed, and Elinor
began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of
finding time for conversation at the park.  They all rose up in
preparation for a round game.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton/Middleton</b></font>)</div>said Lady Middleton to Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``you are not going to finish
poor little Annamaria's basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt
your eyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make the dear
little love some amends for her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) disappointment to-morrow, and then I
hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) will not much mind it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,
<div class="bookquote">``Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting
to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have
been at my filigree already.  I would not disappoint the little angel
for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am
resolved to finish the basket after supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes--will you ring the
bell for some working candles?  My poor little girl would be sadly
disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for
though I told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) it certainly would not, I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) depends upon
having it done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy directly drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) work table near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and reseated herself with an
alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could taste no
greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.

<p/>Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.  No one made
any objection but Marianne, who with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) usual inattention to the forms
of general civility, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Your Ladyship will have the goodness
to excuse ME--you know I detest cards.  I shall go to the piano-forte;
I have not touched it since it was tuned.''   (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>And without farther
ceremony, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) turned away and walked to the instrument.

<p/>Lady Middleton looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) thanked heaven that SHE had never made
so rude a speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma'am,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; <div class="bookquote">``and I do not
much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever
heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>The remaining five were now to draw their cards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``if I should happen to cut out, I may be
of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) papers for her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>); and
there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be
impossible I think for her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) labour singly, to finish it this evening.  I
should like the work exceedingly, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) would allow me a share in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy,
<div class="bookquote">``for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was;
and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Miss Steele-- <div class="bookquote">``Dear little
soul, how I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton/Middleton</b></font>)</div>said Lady Middleton to Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``and as you really
like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till
another rubber, or will you take your chance now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a
little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to
practise, gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same
time.  Lucy made room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with ready attention, and the two fair
rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the
utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.  The pianoforte at
which Marianne, wrapped up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own music and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own thoughts, had
by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,
was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might
safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting
subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.



<p/>CHAPTER 24


<p/>In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,
if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its
subject.  I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy warmly, <div class="bookquote">``for breaking the ice; you have set my
heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended
you by what I told you that Monday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>and Elinor spoke
it with the truest sincerity, <div class="bookquote">``nothing could be farther from my
intention than to give you such an idea.  Could you have a motive for
the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet I do assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>replied Lucy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) little sharp eyes full of
meaning, <div class="bookquote">``there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your
manner that made me quite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you was
angry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for
having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.  But I am
very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not
blame me.  If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my
heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of
my life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am
sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,
to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall
never have reason to repent it.  Your case is a very unfortunate one;
you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have
need of all your mutual affection to support you under them.  Mr.
Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) has only two thousand pounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) own; it would be madness to
marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect
of more without a sigh.  I have been always used to a very small
income, and could struggle with any poverty for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>); but I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) too
well to be the selfish means of robbing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), perhaps, of all that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
mother might give him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) married to please her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).  We must wait, it
may be for many years.  With almost every other man in the world, it
would be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and constancy
nothing can deprive me of I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That conviction must be every thing to you; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is undoubtedly
supported by the same trust in your's.  If the strength of your
reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under
many circumstances it naturally would during a four years' engagement,
your situation would have been pitiable, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) countenance
from every expression that could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) words a suspicious tendency.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Edward's love for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``has been pretty well put to the
test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and
it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt
it now.  I can safely say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has never gave me one moment's alarm
on that account from the first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.

<p/>Lucy went on.  <div class="bookquote">``I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from
our different situations in life, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) being so much more in the
world than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for
suspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been
the slightest alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) behaviour to me when we met, or any
lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had talked
more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy at
Longstaple than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) used to be.  I do not mean to say that I am
particularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case
I am sure I could not be deceived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>thought Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``is very pretty; but it can impose upon
neither of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) after a short silence, <div class="bookquote">``are your views? or have
you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a
melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son determined to submit to
this, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which
it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) displeasure for a
while by owning the truth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we could be certain that it would be only for a while!  But Mrs.
Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) first fit of anger
upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, and
the idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away all my inclination
for hasty measures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness
beyond reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>asked Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all--I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>); but I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) is very unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
brother--silly and a great coxcomb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great coxcomb!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those
words by a sudden pause in Marianne's music.-- <div class="bookquote">``Oh, they are talking of
their favourite beaux, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux
are NOT great coxcombs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings,
laughing heartily; <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved
young men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is such a sly little
creature, there is no finding out who SHE likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, <div class="bookquote">``I dare
say Lucy's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss
Dashwood's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor blushed in spite of herself.  Lucy bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lip, and looked
angrily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sister.  A mutual silence took place for some time.
Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne
was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent
concerto--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my
head, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into
the secret, for you are a party concerned.  I dare say you have seen
enough of Edward to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would prefer the church to every other
profession; now my plan is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should take orders as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kind
enough to use out of friendship for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and I hope out of some regard
to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) Norland living;
which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent not
likely to live a great while.  That would be enough for us to marry
upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should always be happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``to show any mark of my
esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my
interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) is
brother to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward's going into
orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were again silent for many minutes.  At length Lucy exclaimed with
a deep sigh,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at
once by dissolving the engagement.  We seem so beset with difficulties
on every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we
should be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will not give me your
advice, Miss Dashwood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated
feelings, <div class="bookquote">``on such a subject I certainly will not.  You know very well
that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the
side of your wishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you wrong me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>replied Lucy, with great solemnity; <div class="bookquote">``I know
nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do
really believe, that if you was to say to me, 'I advise you by all
means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be
more for the happiness of both of you,' I should resolve upon doing it
immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's future wife, and
replied, <div class="bookquote">``This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any
opinion on the subject had I formed one.  It raises my influence much
too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too
much for an indifferent person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward wife</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis because you are an indifferent person,'' said Lucy, with some
pique, and laying a particular stress on those words, <div class="bookquote">``that your
judgment might justly have such weight with me.  If you could be
supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion
would not be worth having.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might
provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve; and
was even partly determined never to mention the subject again.  Another
pause therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech, and
Lucy was still the first to end it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) with all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) accustomary complacency.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eyes brightened at
the information, <div class="bookquote">``it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you
there!  But I dare say you will go for all that.  To be sure, your
brother and sister will ask you to come to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there.
Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who
have been wanting us to visit them these several years!  But I only go
for the sake of seeing Edward.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) will be there in February, otherwise
London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first
rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore
at an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, for
nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other
less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card table
with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without
affection for the person who was to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wife; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had not
even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincere
affection on HER side would have given, for self-interest alone could
induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed so
thoroughly aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was weary.

<p/>From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when
entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it,
and was particularly careful to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) confidante, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) happiness
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) received a letter from Edward, it was treated by the
former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility
would allow; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt such conversations to be an indulgence which
Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.

<p/>The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond
what the first invitation implied.  Their favour increased; they could
not be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of
their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of the
absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which was
in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to stay
nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration of
that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private
balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance.



<p/>CHAPTER 25


<p/>Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of
the year at the houses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) children and friends, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was not without
a settled habitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own.  Since the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) husband, who
had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had
resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman
Square.  Towards this home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) began on the approach of January to
turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thoughts, and thither she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) one day abruptly, and very
unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>).
Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, and the
animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave
a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed herself
to be speaking their united inclinations.  The reason alleged was their
determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the
year.  Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, and
repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) invitation immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I DO beg
you will favour me with your company, for I've quite set my heart upon
it.  Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shan't
put myself at all out of my way for you.  It will only be sending Betty
by the coach, and I hope I can afford THAT.  We three shall be able to
go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town, if you do not like
to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one of my
daughters.  I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I have had
such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will
think me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I don't
get one of you at least well married before I have done with you, it
shall not be my fault.  I shall speak a good word for you to all the
young men, you may depend upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a notion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Sir John, <div class="bookquote">``that Miss Marianne would not object
to such a scheme, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) elder sister would come into it.  It is very
hard indeed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) should not have a little pleasure, because Miss
Dashwood does not wish it.  So I would advise you two, to set off for
town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss
Dashwood about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jennings, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of
Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the
more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable for
them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk
to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.  But one or
the other, if not both of them, I must have.  Lord bless me! how do you
think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till
this winter to have Charlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, let us
strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
mind by and bye, why so much the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, with warmth:
<div class="bookquote">``your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give
me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,
to be able to accept it.  But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I
feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) were to be made
less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing should
tempt me to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).  It should not, must not be a struggle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Jennings repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare
them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, and saw
to what indifference to almost every thing else she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was carried by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct
opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's
decision, from whom however she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) scarcely expected to receive any
support in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) endeavour to prevent a visit, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not
approve of for Marianne, and which on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own account she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
particular reasons to avoid.  Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother would be eager to promote--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not expect to influence the
latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
never been able to inspire her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) with distrust; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dared not explain
the motive of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own disinclination for going to London.  That
Marianne, fastidious as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.
Jennings' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook
every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be
most wounding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) irritable feelings, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) pursuit of one object,
was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to
witness.

<p/>On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such
an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
daughters, and perceiving through all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) affectionate attention to
herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of
their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on their both
accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) usual
cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,
from this separation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted with the plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``it is exactly what I could
wish.  Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.
When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and
happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret
so improved when you come back again!  I have a little plan of
alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without
any inconvenience to any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go to
town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life
acquainted with the manners and amusements of London.  You will be
under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to
you I can have no doubt.  And in all probability you will see your
brother, and whatever may be his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) faults, or the faults of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife,
when I consider whose son he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly
estranged from each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``you
have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which
occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,
cannot be so easily removed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne's countenance sunk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood, <div class="bookquote">``is my dear prudent Elinor going to
suggest?  What formidable obstacle is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now to bring forward?  Do let
me hear a word about the expense of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings's
heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or
whose protection will give us consequence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``but of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) society,
separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing
at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady
Middleton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Elinor is frightened away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dislike of Mrs. Jennings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said
Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``at least it need not prevent MY accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) invitation.  I
have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every
unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards
the manners of a person, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had often had difficulty in
persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved
within herself, that if her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister persisted in going, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would go
likewise, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not think it proper that Marianne should be left
to the sole guidance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should
be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
domestic hours.  To this determination she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was the more easily
reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account, was
not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without any
unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will have you BOTH go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood; <div class="bookquote">``these objections are
nonsensical.  You will have much pleasure in being in London, and
especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to
anticipate enjoyment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would foresee it there from a variety of
sources; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would, perhaps, expect some from improving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law's family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the
shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this
attack, though almost hopeless of success, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) forced herself to begin
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) design by saying, as calmly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could, <div class="bookquote">``I like Edward Ferrars
very much, and shall always be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>); but as to the rest of
the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I am
ever known to them or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.  Marianne lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes in
astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might as well have held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) tongue.

<p/>After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the
invitation should be fully accepted.  Mrs. Jennings received the
information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness
and care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>).  Sir John was
delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of
being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in
London, was something.  Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being
delighted, which was putting herself rather out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) way; and as for
the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in
their lives as this intelligence made them.

<p/>Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wishes with
less reluctance than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had expected to feel.  With regard to herself,
it was now a matter of unconcern whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) went to town or not, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) usual animation, and elevated to more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) usual gaiety, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow
herself to distrust the consequence.

<p/>Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the
perturbation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) impatience to be gone.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
unwillingness to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) only restorative to calmness;
and at the moment of parting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) grief on that score was excessive.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of
the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of
eternal.

<p/>Their departure took place in the first week in January.  The
Middletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss Steeles kept their
station at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the
family.



<p/>CHAPTER 26


<p/>Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and
beginning a journey to London under her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) protection, and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) guest,
without wondering at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own situation, so short had their acquaintance
with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and
disposition, and so many had been her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) objections against such a measure
only a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happy
ardour of youth which Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother equally shared, been
overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt
of Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful
expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of
Marianne, without feeling how blank was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own prospect, how cheerless
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would
engage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation to have the same
animating object in view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, a
very short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentions
were; in all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was already in town.  Marianne's eagerness
to be gone declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dependence on finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) there; and Elinor was
resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) character
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own observation or the intelligence of others could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
but likewise upon watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister with such
zealous attention, as to ascertain what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) meant,
before many meetings had taken place.  Should the result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
observations be unfavourable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was determined at all events to open
the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister; should it be otherwise, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exertions would be
of a different nature--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) must then learn to avoid every selfish
comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) satisfaction
in the happiness of Marianne.

<p/>They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as they
travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and
companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sat in
silence almost all the way, wrapt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own meditations, and scarcely
ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty
within their view drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) an exclamation of delight exclusively
addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister.  To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor
took immediate possession of the post of civility which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had
assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,
talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), laughed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), and listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
could; and Mrs. Jennings on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) side treated them both with all
possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and
enjoyment, and only disturbed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could not make them choose their
own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring
salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.  They reached town by
three o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,
from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury
of a good fire.

<p/>The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies
were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment.  It
had formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung a
landscape in coloured silks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) performance, in proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) having
spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.

<p/>As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their
arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother, and sat down for that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne did
the same.  <div class="bookquote">``I am writing home, Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``had not you
better defer your letter for a day or two?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am NOT going to write to my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>replied Marianne, hastily, and
as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it
immediately struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) must then be writing to Willoughby; and
the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however
mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be
engaged.  This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
pleasure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) letter with greater alacrity.
Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no
more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with
eager rapidity.  Elinor thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could distinguish a large W in the
direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the
bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to the two-penny post.  This decided the matter at once.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them
which prevented their giving much pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, and this
agitation increased as the evening drew on.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could scarcely eat any
dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed
anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.

<p/>It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much
engaged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own room, could see little of what was passing.  The tea
things were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more
than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly
heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor
felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach, and Marianne,
starting up, moved towards the door.  Every thing was silent; this
could not be borne many seconds; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) opened the door, advanced a few
steps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned
into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feelings at that
instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not help exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby,
indeed it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) arms,
when Colonel Brandon appeared.

<p/>It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) immediately
left the room.  Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) welcome with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt
particularly hurt that a man so partial to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister should perceive
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even
observed Marianne as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) quitted the room, with such astonishment and
concern, as hardly left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the recollection of what civility demanded
towards herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your sister ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor answered in some distress that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was, and then talked of
head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could decently attribute her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's behaviour.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect
himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about
their journey, and the friends they had left behind.

<p/>In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,
they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts
of both engaged elsewhere.  Elinor wished very much to ask whether
Willoughby were then in town, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was afraid of giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) pain by
any enquiry after his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) rival; and at length, by way of saying something,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had been in London ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) last.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) replied, with some embarrassment, <div class="bookquote">``almost ever since; I have
been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in
my power to return to Barton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) remembrance all the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) quitting that place, with
the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
was fearful that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) question had implied much more curiosity on the
subject than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had ever felt.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) usual
noisy cheerfulness, <div class="bookquote">``I am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could not
come before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a
little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been
at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do
after one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to
settle with-- Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!
But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town
today?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's, where I have been
dining.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house?  How does
Charlotte do?  I warrant you she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is a fine size by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,
that you will certainly see her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel, I have brought two
young ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now,
but there is another somewhere.  Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which
you will not be sorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr.
Willoughby will do between you about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  Ay, it is a fine thing to be
young and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I never was very
handsome--worse luck for me.  However, I got a very good husband, and I
don't know what the greatest beauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
been dead these eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have you
been to since we parted?  And how does your business go on?  Come,
come, let's have no secrets among friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) replied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) accustomary mildness to all her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) inquiries, but
without satisfying her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) in any.  Elinor now began to make the tea, and
Marianne was obliged to appear again.

<p/>After her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to
stay long.  No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were
unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.

<p/>Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.
The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the
expectation of what was to happen that day.  They had not long finished
their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and
in a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) came laughing into the room: so delighted to see
them all, that it was hard to say whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) received most pleasure
from meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) mother or the Miss Dashwoods again.  So surprised at
their coming to town, though it was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) had rather expected all
along; so angry at their accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) mother's invitation after having
declined her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own, though at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) would never have forgiven
them if they had not come!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``What do you think
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) said when he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) heard of your coming with Mama?  I forget what it was
now, but it was something so droll!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After an hour or two spent in what her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) mother called comfortable chat,
or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their
acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side, and in laughter without cause on
Mrs. Palmer's, it was proposed by the latter that they should all
accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to some shops where she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) had business that morning, to
which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise
some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it at
first was induced to go likewise.

<p/>Wherever they went, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was evidently always on the watch.  In Bond
Street especially, where much of their business lay, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes were in
constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mind
was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all
that interested and occupied the others.  Restless and dissatisfied
every where, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister could never obtain her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) opinion of any article
of purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) received
no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home again, and
could with difficulty govern her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) vexation at the tediousness of Mrs.
Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new;
who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
time in rapture and indecision.

<p/>It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner had
they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when
Elinor followed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) turning from the table with a sorrowful
countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to
the footman who then entered with the parcels.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was answered in the
negative.  <div class="bookquote">``Are you quite sure of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) replied.  <div class="bookquote">``Are you certain
that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man replied that none had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very odd!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), in a low and disappointed voice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
turned away to the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How odd, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister
with uneasiness.  <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be in town she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would not
have written to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have written to Combe Magna;
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) is in town, how odd that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) should neither come nor write!
Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement
between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in
so doubtful, so mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how will
MY interference be borne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continued
many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would represent in
the strongest manner to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother the necessity of some serious
enquiry into the affair.

<p/>Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimate
acquaintance, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had met and invited in the morning, dined with
them.  The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) evening
engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table
for the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
would never learn the game; but though her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) time was therefore at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of
expectation and the pain of disappointment.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sometimes endeavoured
for a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and
forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) came to the
window, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.



<p/>CHAPTER 27


<p/><div class="bookquote">``If this open weather holds much longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, when they
met at breakfast the following morning, <div class="bookquote">``Sir John will not like leaving
Barton next week; 'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day's
pleasure.  Poor souls!  I always pity them when they do; they seem to
take it so much to heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to the
window as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spoke, to examine the day.  <div class="bookquote">``I had not thought of that.
This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>all spirits</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a lucky recollection, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) good spirits were restored by it.
<div class="bookquote">``It is charming weather for THEM indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) continued, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sat
down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance.  <div class="bookquote">``How much they
must enjoy it! But''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a little return of anxiety-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``it cannot be
expected to last long.  At this time of the year, and after such a
series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it.  Frosts
will soon set in, and in all probability with severity.  In another day
or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer--nay,
perhaps it may freeze tonight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's thoughts as clearly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did, <div class="bookquote">``I dare say we
shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do.  Mary always has her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>silently conjectured Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) will write to Combe by
this day's post.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) DID, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy
which eluded all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) watchfulness to ascertain the fact.  Whatever the
truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough
contentment about it, yet while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw Marianne in spirits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could
not be very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits; happy
in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expectation of
a frost.

<p/>The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.
Jennings's acquaintance to inform them of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) being in town; and
Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,
watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the
air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There
seems to me a very decided difference.  I can hardly keep my hands warm
even in my muff.  It was not so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seem
parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear
afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,
and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in
the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching
frost.

<p/>The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.
Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind.  Every thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and
excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
had never dropped, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) visited no one to whom an introduction could at
all discompose the feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) young companions.  Pleased to find
herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had
expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real
enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or
abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with
them almost every day; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,
who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) than from
any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much
concern his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) continued regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feared it was a
strengthening regard.  It grieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to see the earnestness with which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) often watched Marianne, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) spirits were certainly worse than
when at Barton.

<p/>About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby was
also arrived.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) card was on the table when they came in from the
morning's drive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has been here while we were out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) being in London, now ventured to
say, <div class="bookquote">``Depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will call again tomorrow.''   (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>But Marianne
seemed hardly to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped with
the precious card.

<p/>This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister all, and more than all, their former agitation.  From this
moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) every
hour of the day, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) unfit for any thing.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) insisted on being
left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.

<p/>Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street
during their absence; but a moment's glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister when they
returned was enough to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), that Willoughby had paid no second
visit there.  A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am, for my mistress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are expecting a letter, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, unable to be longer
silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a little--not much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short pause.  <div class="bookquote">``You have no confidence in me, Marianne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have confidence in no
one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>returned Elinor in some confusion; <div class="bookquote">``indeed, Marianne, I have
nothing to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>answered Marianne with energy, <div class="bookquote">``our situations then are alike.
We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do not
communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to
press for greater openness in Marianne.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) read it
aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit
Street the night before, and requesting the company of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother and
cousins the following evening.  Business on Sir John's part, and a
violent cold on her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.
The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew
near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that
they should both attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty
in persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister to go, for still she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen nothing of
Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad,
than unwilling to run the risk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) calling again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) absence.

<p/>Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not
materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled
in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), nearly twenty
young people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was an affair,
however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.  In the country, an
unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the
reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it
was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it
known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine
couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had
not seen before since their arrival in town, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) was careful to avoid
the appearance of any attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother-in-law, and therefore
never came near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>), they received no mark of recognition on their
entrance.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they
were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the
room.  Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) entered: it
was enough--HE (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) was not there--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sat down, equally ill-disposed to
receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been assembled about
an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
surprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first
informed of their arrival at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had himself said
something very droll on hearing that they were to come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were both in Devonshire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When do you go back again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And thus ended their discourse.

<p/>Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) life, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was
that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, <div class="bookquote">``we know the reason of all that very
well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you
would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very
pretty of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not to give you the meeting when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was invited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Invited!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
somewhere in the street this morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>Marianne said no more, but
looked exceedingly hurt.  Impatient in this situation to be doing
something that might lead to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's relief, Elinor resolved to
write the next morning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother, and hoped by awakening her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fears
for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been
so long delayed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was still more eagerly bent on this measure by
perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again
writing to Willoughby, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not suppose it to be to any other
person.

<p/>About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on
business, and Elinor began her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) letter directly, while Marianne, too
restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one
window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.
Elinor was very earnest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) application to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, relating all
that had passed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) suspicions of Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) real situation with respect to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and
Colonel Brandon was announced.  Marianne, who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) from the
window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
entered it.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked more than usually grave, and though expressing
satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had somewhat in
particular to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), sat for some time without saying a word.
Elinor, persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had some communication to make in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.  It was not the
first time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than
once before, beginning with the observation of <div class="bookquote">``your sister looks
unwell to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``your sister seems out of spirits,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had appeared
on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something
particular about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).  After a pause of several minutes, their silence
was broken, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) asking her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in a voice of some agitation, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was
to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not
prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged
to adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) meant?  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
tried to smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``your sister's engagement to Mr.
Willoughby is very generally known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot be generally known,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>returned Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own family do
not know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) looked surprised and said, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, I am afraid my
inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy
intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally
talked of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are
most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons.  But
still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps
rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to
support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,
accidentally seen a letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in
your sister's writing.  I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I
could ask the question.  Is every thing finally settled?  Is it
impossible to-?  But I have no right, and I could have no chance of
succeeding.  Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong in
saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I
have the strongest dependence.  Tell me that it is all absolutely
resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if
concealment be possible, is all that remains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) love for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) very much.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not immediately able to
say anything, and even when her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits were recovered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) debated for
a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.  The real
state of things between Willoughby and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister was so little known
to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might be as liable
to say too much as too little.  Yet as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was convinced that
Marianne's affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel
Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and
at the same time wished to shield her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) conduct from censure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) thought
it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) really knew or believed.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) acknowledged, therefore, that though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they
stood with each other, of their mutual affection she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had no doubt, and
of their correspondence she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was not astonished to hear.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) with silent attention, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) ceasing to speak,
rose directly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,
<div class="bookquote">``to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
may endeavour to deserve her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--took leave, and went away.

<p/>Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to
lessen the uneasiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind on other points; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was left, on the
contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's
unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.



<p/>CHAPTER 28


<p/>Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor
regret what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had done, in applying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother; for Willoughby
neither came nor wrote.  They were engaged about the end of that time
to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept
away by the indisposition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) youngest daughter; and for this party,
Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) appearance, and seeming
equally indifferent whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went or staid, prepared, without one
look of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sat by the
drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton's
arrival, without once stirring from her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) seat, or altering her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) attitude,
lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own thoughts, and insensible of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) sister's presence; and
when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the
door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) started as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had forgotten that any one was expected.

<p/>They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as
the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the
stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to another
in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite full
of company, and insufferably hot.  When they had paid their tribute of
politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted
to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and
inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add.  After some
time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to
Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) and
Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great
distance from the table.

<p/>They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived
Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest
conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soon
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) eye, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) immediately bowed, but without attempting to
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or to approach Marianne, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could not but see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);
and then continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) discourse with the same lady.  Elinor turned
involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).  At that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) whole countenance
glowing with sudden delight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have moved towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
instantly, had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is there--he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is there--Oh! why does
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) not look at me? why cannot I speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray be composed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``and do not betray what you
feel to every body present.  Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has not observed you yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>This however was more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could believe herself; and to be
composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne, it
was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wish.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sat in an agony of impatience which affected
every feature.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) turned round again, and regarded them both; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) started up,
and pronouncing his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) name in a tone of affection, held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than
Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eye, and determined not to observe
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and
asked how long they had been in town.  Elinor was robbed of all
presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word.  But
the feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister were instantly expressed.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) face was
crimsoned over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,
<div class="bookquote">``Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?  Have you not
received my letters?  Will you not shake hands with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could not then avoid it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) touch seemed painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand only for a moment.  During all this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was evidently
struggling for composure.  Elinor watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) countenance and saw its
expression becoming more tranquil.  After a moment's pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) spoke
with calmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,
and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find
yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home.  My card was not lost, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But have you not received my notes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne in the wildest
anxiety.  <div class="bookquote">``Here is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake.  What
can be the meaning of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell
me, what is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) made no reply; his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) complexion changed and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) embarrassment
returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
had been previously talking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) felt the necessity of instant exertion,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) recovered himself again, and after saying, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I had the pleasure
of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so
good as to send me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) faint, tried
to screen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) from the observation of others, while reviving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with
lavender water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) cried, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could speak, <div class="bookquote">``and force
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) to come to me.  Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) again--must speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
instantly.-- I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till this
is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait.  This is
not the place for explanations.  Wait only till tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With difficulty however could she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from following him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
herself; and to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to check her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) agitation, to wait, at least,
with the appearance of composure, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) might speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) with more
privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued
incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feelings,
by exclamations of wretchedness.  In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby
quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) again that
evening, as a fresh argument for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to be calm.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) instantly begged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was
too miserable to stay a minute longer.

<p/>Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed
that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
wish of going away, and making over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cards to a friend, they
departed as soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word was
spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.  Marianne was in a
silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings
was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,
where hartshorn restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) a little to herself.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was soon
undressed and in bed, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) seemed desirous of being alone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
sister then left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) waited the return of Mrs. Jennings,
had leisure enough for thinking over the past.

<p/>That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and
Marianne she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,
seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own
wishes, SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or
misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough change of
sentiment could account for it.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) indignation would have been still
stronger than it was, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not witnessed that embarrassment which
seemed to speak a consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own misconduct, and prevented
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from believing him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) so unprincipled as to have been sporting with
the affections of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister from the first, without any design that
would bear investigation.  Absence might have weakened his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) regard, and
convenience might have determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) to overcome it, but that such a
regard had formerly existed she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not bring herself to doubt.

<p/>As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already
have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and on those still more severe which might await her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in
its probable consequence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not reflect without the deepest
concern.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own situation gained in the comparison; for while she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided in
future, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mind might be always supported.  But every circumstance
that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery
of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate and
irreconcilable rupture with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER 29


<p/>Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun
gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, only
half dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake
of all the little light she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could command from it, and writing as fast
as a continual flow of tears would permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  In this situation,
Elinor, roused from sleep by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) agitation and sobs, first perceived
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); and after observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for a few moments with silent anxiety,
said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marianne, may I ask-?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``ask nothing; you will soon know all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no
longer than while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke, and was immediately followed by a return
of the same excessive affliction.  It was some minutes before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could
go on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still
obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), at intervals, to withhold her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pen, were proofs enough of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feeling how more than probable it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was writing for the
last time to Willoughby.

<p/>Elinor paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) power; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) still more, had not
Marianne entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), with all the eagerness of the most nervous
irritability, not to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) for the world.  In such
circumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long
together; and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from remaining in the room a moment after she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was dressed, but
requiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of every
body.

<p/>At breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and
Elinor's attention was then all employed, not in urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), not in
pitying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), nor in appearing to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), but in endeavouring to
engage Mrs. Jennings's notice entirely to herself.

<p/>As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a
considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,
round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to
Marianne, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a
death-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw as
plainly by this, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen the direction, that it must come
from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
hardly able to hold up her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) head, and sat in such a general tremour as
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings's notice.  That good
lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from
Willoughby, which appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a very good joke, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would find it to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) liking.  Of Elinor's distress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was too busily employed in
measuring lengths of worsted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) rug, to see any thing at all; and
calmly continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my
life!  MY girls were nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), and yet they used to be foolish
enough; but as for Miss Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is quite an altered creature.  I
hope, from the bottom of my heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) won't keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) waiting much
longer, for it is quite grievous to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) look so ill and forlorn.
Pray, when are they to be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,
obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,
trying to smile, replied, <div class="bookquote">``And have you really, Ma'am, talked yourself
into a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  I
thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to
imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive
yourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing would surprise me
more than to hear of their being going to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so?  Don't we
all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in
love with each other from the first moment they met?  Did not I see
them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I
know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding
clothes?  Come, come, this won't do.  Because you are so sly about it
yourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such
thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever so
long.  I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, very seriously, <div class="bookquote">``you are mistaken.
Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and
you will find that you have though you will not believe me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,
and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried
away to their room, where, on opening the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw Marianne
stretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand,
and two or three others laying by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  Elinor drew near, but without
saying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand, kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of
tears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The
latter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of
this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
put all the letters into Elinor's hands; and then covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) face
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) handkerchief, almost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew
that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its
course, watched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent
itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter, read as
follows:

<p/>``Bond Street, January.
``MY DEAR MADAM,

<p/>``I have just had the honour of receiving your
letter, for which I beg to return my sincere
acknowledgments.  I am much concerned to find there
was anything in my behaviour last night that did
not meet your approbation; and though I am quite at
a loss to discover in what point I could be so
unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your
forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been
perfectly unintentional.  I shall never reflect on
my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire
without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter
myself it will not be broken by any mistake or
misapprehension of my actions.  My esteem for your
whole family is very sincere; but if I have been so
unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than
I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself
for not having been more guarded in my professions
of that esteem.  That I should ever have meant more
you will allow to be impossible, when you understand
that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,
and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before
this engagement is fulfilled.  It is with great
regret that I obey your commands in returning the
letters with which I have been honoured from you,
and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed
on me.

<p/>``I am, dear Madam,
``Your most obedient
``humble servant,
<div class="bookquote">``JOHN WILLOUGHBY.''


 (<font color='red'><b>servant WILLOUGHBY</b></font>)</div><p/>With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss
Dashwood, may be imagined.  Though aware, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) began it, that it
must bring a confession of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) inconstancy, and confirm their
separation for ever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was not aware that such language could be
suffered to announce it; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) have supposed Willoughby capable
of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and
delicate feeling--so far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as to
send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringing
with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no
breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--a letter of
which every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to be
deep in hardened villainy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then read
it again and again; but every perusal only served to increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feelings against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) dared not trust herself to speak, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might wound
Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most
irremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled
man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the
depravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the
very different mind of a very different person, who had no other
connection whatever with the affair than what her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) heart gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with
every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister, forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had three letters on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lap yet unread, and so
entirely forgot how long she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been in the room, that when on hearing
a carriage drive up to the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) went to the window to see who
could be coming so unreasonably early, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was all astonishment to
perceive Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) knew had not been ordered
till one.  Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of
contributing, at present, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ease, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hurried away to excuse
herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister being
indisposed.  Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for
its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) found attempting to rise
from the bed, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) reached just in time to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from
falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest
and food; for it was many days since she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had any appetite, and many
nights since she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had really slept; and now, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mind was no longer
supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this was
felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous
faintness.  A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) directly,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) more comfortable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was at last able to express some
sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) kindness, by saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``there were any thing I COULD do,
which might be of comfort to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,
who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Elinor, I am
miserable, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) voice was entirely lost in sobs.

<p/>Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in
silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exert yourself, dear Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``if you would not kill
yourself and all who love you.  Think of your mother; think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
misery while YOU suffer: for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sake you must exert yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot, I cannot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne; <div class="bookquote">``leave me, leave me, if I
distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!  but do not torture me so.
Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of
exertion!  Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I
suffer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you call ME happy, Marianne?  Ah! if you knew!--And can you believe
me to be so, while I see you so wretched!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's neck; <div class="bookquote">``I
know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you
are--you must be happy; Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do away
such happiness as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Many, many circumstances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne wildly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) loves you, and only you.  You
CAN have no grief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will never see me otherwise.  Mine is a misery which nothing
can do away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not talk so, Marianne.  Have you no comforts? no friends?  Is
your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation?  Much as you
suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) character had been delayed to a later period--if your engagement
had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been,
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chose to put an end to it.  Every additional day of unhappy
confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Engagement!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``there has been no engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No engagement!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is not so unworthy as you believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has broken no faith
with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) told you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) loved you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--no--never absolutely.  It was every day implied, but never
professedly declared.  Sometimes I thought it had been--but it never
was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet you wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--could that be wrong after all that had passed?-- But I cannot
talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now
raised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the
contents of all.  The first, which was what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) on
their arrival in town, was to this effect.

<p/>Berkeley Street, January.

<p/>``How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on
receiving this; and I think you will feel something
more than surprise, when you know that I am in town.
An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs.
Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist.
I wish you may receive this in time to come here
to-night, but I will not depend on it.  At any rate
I shall expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``M.D.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Middletons</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance
at the Middletons', was in these words:--

<p/>``I cannot express my disappointment in having
missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment
at not having received any answer to a note which
I sent you above a week ago.  I have been expecting
to hear from you, and still more to see you, every
hour of the day.  Pray call again as soon as possible,
and explain the reason of my having expected this
in vain.  You had better come earlier another time,
because we are generally out by one.  We were last
night at Lady Middleton's, where there was a dance.
I have been told that you were asked to be of the
party.  But could it be so?  You must be very much
altered indeed since we parted, if that could be
the case, and you not there.  But I will not suppose
this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your
personal assurance of its being otherwise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``M.D.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The contents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) last note to him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) were these:--

<p/>``What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your
behaviour last night?  Again I demand an explanation
of it.  I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure
which our separation naturally produced, with the
familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared
to me to justify.  I was repulsed indeed! I have
passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse
a conduct which can scarcely be called less than
insulting; but though I have not yet been able to
form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,
I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of
it.  You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely
deceived, in something concerning me, which may have
lowered me in your opinion.  Tell me what it is,
explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall
be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.  It
would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill
of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that
you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that
your regard for us all was insincere, that your
behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let
it be told as soon as possible.  My feelings are at
present in a state of dreadful indecision; I wish
to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be
ease to what I now suffer.  If your sentiments are
no longer what they were, you will return my notes,
and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``M.D.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have been
so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake, would have been unwilling
to believe.  But her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) condemnation of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) did not blind her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to the
impropriety of their having been written at all; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was silently
grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs
of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severely
condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had finished
the letters, observed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) that they contained nothing but what any
one would have written in the same situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``to be as solemnly engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), as if
the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``but unfortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) did not feel the
same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) felt it.  I know
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) did.  Whatever may have changed him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) now, -LRB-and nothing but the
blackest art employed against me can have done it-RRB-, I was once as dear
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) as my own soul could wish.  This lock of hair, which now he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) can
so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest
supplication.  Had you seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) look, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) manner, had you heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
voice at that moment!  Have you forgot the last evening of our being
together at Barton?  The morning that we parted too!  When he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) told me
that it might be many weeks before we met again--his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) distress--can I
ever forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) distress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment or two she (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could say no more; but when this emotion had
passed away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) added, in a firmer tone,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  By whom can he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) have been
instigated?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all the world, rather than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own heart.  I could rather
believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) opinion, than believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) nature capable of such cruelty.  This
woman of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) writes--whoever she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be--or any one, in short, but your
own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me.
Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not
rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor would not contend, and only replied, <div class="bookquote">``Whoever may have been so
detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,
my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own
innocence and good intentions supports your spirits.  It is a
reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``misery such as mine has no pride.  I care
not who knows that I am wretched.  The triumph of seeing me so may be
open to all the world.  Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be
proud and independent as they like--may resist insult, or return
mortification--but I cannot.  I must feel--I must be wretched--and they
are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But for my mother's sake and mine--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would do more than for my own.  But to appear happy when I am so
miserable--Oh! who can require it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Again they were both silent.  Elinor was employed in walking
thoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,
without knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) received warmth from one, or discerning
objects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head leaning against one of its posts, again took up
Willoughby's letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,
exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!
Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.  Elinor, nothing can.  Whatever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) might have heard against me--ought he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) not to have suspended his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
belief? ought he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) not to have told me of it, to have given me the power
of clearing myself? `The lock of hair, -LRB-repeating it from the letter,-RRB-
which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable.
Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?  Oh,
barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) be justified?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet this woman--who knows what her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) art may have been?--how long it
may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!--Who is

attractive among his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one--he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
talked to me only of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Elinor, I must go home.  I must go and comfort mama.  Can not we be

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow, Marianne!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby's sake--and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much more

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long, I
cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.
The Middletons and Palmers--how am I to bear their pity?  The pity of
such a woman as Lady Middleton!  Oh, what would HE (<font color='blue'><b>Palmers</b></font>) say to that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to lie down again, and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did so; but
no attitude could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ease; and in restless pain of mind and body
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more
hysterical, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister could with difficulty keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) on the bed at
all, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for
assistance.  Some lavender drops, however, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was at length
persuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings
returned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) continued on the bed quiet and motionless.



<p/>CHAPTER 30


<p/>Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) return, and without
waiting to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) request of admittance answered, opened the door and
walked in with a look of real concern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do my dear?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) in a voice of great compassion to
Marianne, who turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) face without attempting to answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) looks very bad.-- No
wonder.  Ay, it is but too true.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is to be married very soon--a
good-for-nothing fellow!  I have no patience with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>).  Mrs. Taylor
told me of it half an hour ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) was told it by a particular
friend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed
it; and I was almost ready to sink as it was.  Well, said I, all I can
say is, that if this be true, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has used a young lady of my
acquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife may
plague his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heart out.  And so I shall always say, my dear, you may
depend on it.  I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if
ever I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) again, I will give him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) such a dressing as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has not
had this many a day.  But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne;
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is not the only young man in the world worth having; and with your
pretty face you will never want admirers.  Well, poor thing!  I won't
disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) any longer, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had better have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cry out at once and
have done with.  The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight
you know, and that will amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) young friend's affliction could be increased by noise.

<p/>Marianne, to the surprise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, determined on dining with
them.  Elinor even advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) against it.  But <div class="bookquote">``no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would go down;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could bear it very well, and the bustle about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would be less.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>Elinor, pleased to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) governed for a moment by such a motive,
though believing it hardly possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could sit out the dinner,
said no more; and adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dress for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could,
while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) into
the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.

<p/>When there, though looking most wretchedly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ate more and was calmer
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister had expected.  Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tried to speak, or had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) been
conscious of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentions
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a
syllable escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lips; and the abstraction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thoughts
preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though its
effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) those acknowledgments, and returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) those civilities, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
sister could not make or return for herself.  Their good friend saw
that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
which might make her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) at all less so.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) therefore, with
all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the
last day of its holidays.  Marianne was to have the best place by the
fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to
be amused by the relation of all the news of the day.  Had not Elinor,
in the sad countenance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, seen a check to all mirth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a
disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a
good fire.  As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was
forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could stay no longer.
With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister not to
follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) directly got up and hurried out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was gone, <div class="bookquote">``how it
grieves me to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)!  And I declare if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is not gone away without
finishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wine!  And the dried cherries too!  Lord! nothing seems
to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) any good.  I am sure if I knew of any thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) would like, I
would send all over the town for it.  Well, it is the oddest thing to
me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill!  But when there is
plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless
you! they care no more about such things!--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady then--Miss Grey I think you called her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)--is very rich?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  Did you ever see her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)? a smart,
stylish girl they say, but not handsome.  I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt very
well, Biddy Henshawe; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) married a very wealthy man.  But the family
are all rich together.  Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it
won't come before it's wanted; for they say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is all to pieces.  No
wonder! dashing about with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) curricle and hunters!  Well, it don't
signify talking; but when a young man, be who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will, comes and makes
love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no business to fly
off from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word only because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grows poor, and a richer girl is
ready to have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  Why don't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in such a case, sell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horses, let
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, turn off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I
warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters
came round.  But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the way of
pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?  Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said to be
amiable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard any harm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>); indeed I hardly ever heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day
Miss Walker hinted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would
not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) and Mrs. Ellison could
never agree.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who are the Ellisons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) guardians, my dear.  But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) is of age and may choose for
herself; and a pretty choice she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) has made!--What now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>after pausing a
moment--<div class="bookquote">``your poor sister is gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own room, I suppose, to moan
by herself.  Is there nothing one can get to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?  Poor dear,
it seems quite cruel to let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) be alone.  Well, by-and-by we shall
have a few friends, and that will amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a little.  What shall we
play at?  She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hates whist I know; but is there no round game she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cares
for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.  Marianne, I dare say,
will not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) room again this evening.  I shall persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) if I
can to go early to bed, for I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wants rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, I believe that will be best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) name her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own
supper, and go to bed.  Lord! no wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has been looking so bad and
so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been
hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head as long as that.  And so the letter that came
today finished it!  Poor soul!  I am sure if I had had a notion of it,
I would not have joked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) about it for all my money.  But then you
know, how should I guess such a thing?  I made sure of its being
nothing but a common love letter, and you know young people like to be
laughed at about them.  Lord!  how concerned Sir John and my daughters
will be when they hear it!  If I had my senses about me I might have
called in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it.  But I
shall see them tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and
Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest
allusion to what has passed, before my sister.  Their own good-nature
must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing
about it when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is present; and the less that may ever be said to
myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my
dear madam will easily believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.  It must be terrible for you to hear
it talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a
word about it to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) for the world.  You saw I did not all dinner time.
No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very
thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I
certainly will.  For my part, I think the less that is said about such
things, the better, the sooner 'tis blown over and forgot.  And what
does talking ever do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many cases
of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, for
the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the
public conversation.  I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby--he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has
broken no positive engagement with my sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Law, my dear!  Don't pretend to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).  No positive engagement
indeed! after taking her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) all over Allenham House, and fixing on the
very rooms they were to live in hereafter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's sake, could not press the subject farther, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hoped it was not required of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for Willoughby's; since, though
Marianne might lose much, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could gain very little by the enforcement
of the real truth.  After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) natural hilarity, burst forth again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be
all the better for Colonel Brandon.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will have her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) at last; aye,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will.  Mind me, now, if they an't married by Mid-summer.  Lord!
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll chuckle over this news!  I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will come tonight.  It
will be all to one a better match for your sister.  Two thousand a year
without debt or drawback--except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I
had forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may be `prenticed out at a small cost, and then
what does it signify?  Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you;
exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and
conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered
with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in
one corner!  Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were
there!  Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a
very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;
and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile
from the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit
up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages
that pass along.  Oh! 'tis a nice place!  A butcher hard by in the
village, and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw.  To my fancy,
a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to
send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than
your mother.  Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.
One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.  If we CAN but
put Willoughby out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``we shall do very well
with or without Colonel Brandon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>And then rising, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) went away to
join Marianne, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) found, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) expected, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) own room,
leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,
till Elinor's entrance, had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better leave me,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>was all the notice that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister received
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will leave you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``if you will go to bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>But this,
from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) at first
refused to do.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion,
however, soon softened her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to compliance, and Elinor saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
aching head on the pillow, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hoped, in a way to get some quiet
rest before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>In the drawing-room, whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) then repaired, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was soon joined by
Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), entering, <div class="bookquote">``I have just recollected that I have
some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was
tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister.  My poor
husband! how fond he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was of it!  Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) old
colicky gout, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said it did him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) more good than any thing else in the
world.  Do take it to your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the
complaints for which it was recommended, <div class="bookquote">``how good you are!  But I have
just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think
nothing will be of so much service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) as rest, if you will give me
leave, I will drink the wine myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had not been five minutes
earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a
colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), its healing
powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself
as on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) manner
of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) neither expected nor wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) there, and, in short, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
was already aware of what occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) absence.  Mrs. Jennings was
not struck by the same thought; for soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) entrance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) walked
across the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--
<div class="bookquote">``The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) knows nothing of it;
do tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look
which perfectly assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) good information, inquired after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marianne is not well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has been indisposed all day,
and we have persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to go to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hesitatingly replied, <div class="bookquote">``what I heard this morning
may be--there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at
first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short, that a man,
whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I tell you?  If you know it
already, as surely you must, I may be spared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, with forced calmness, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Willoughby's
marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO know it all.  This seems to have
been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded
it to us.  Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had business.  Two ladies
were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other
an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting
concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The name
of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my
attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing
was now finally settled respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) marriage with Miss Grey--it was
no longer to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,
with many particulars of preparations and other matters.  One thing,
especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still
more:--as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe
Magna, his (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) seat in Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but it would be
impossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative lady I learnt,
on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs.
Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss
Grey's guardian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand
pounds?  In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) stopped
a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, <div class="bookquote">``And
your sister--how did she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sufferings have been very severe.  I have only to hope that they
may be proportionately short.  It has been, it is a most cruel
affliction.  Till yesterday, I believe, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) never doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) regard;
and even now, perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) never was
really attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has been very deceitful! and, in some
points, there seems a hardness of heart about him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said Colonel Brandon, <div class="bookquote">``there is, indeed!  But your sister does
not--I think you said so--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) does not consider quite as you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brandon/Mrs. Brandon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) disposition, and may believe how eagerly she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would still
justify him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the
tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was
necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure
while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss
Dashwood's communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel
Brandon's side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of
hope and happiness, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with amazement, remain the whole evening
more serious and thoughtful than usual.



<p/>CHAPTER 31


<p/>From a night of more sleep than she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had expected, Marianne awoke the
next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had
closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Elinor encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as much as possible to talk of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt; and
before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and
again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on
Elinor's side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on
Marianne's, as before.  Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could believe Willoughby to be as
unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every
consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).  At one moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at
another she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third
could resist it with energy.  In one thing, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was uniform,
when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the
presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged to
endure it.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs.
Jennings's entering into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sorrows with any compassion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no, it cannot be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) cannot feel.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) kindness
is not sympathy; her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wants
is gossip, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) only likes me now because I supply it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister was often led in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion of others, by the irritable
refinement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own mind, and the too great importance placed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished
manner.  Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be
that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an
excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expected
from other people the same opinions and feelings as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on
herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together
in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs.
Jennings still lower in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) estimation; because, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own
weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though
Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.

<p/>With a letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,
from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) entered their room, saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne heard enough.  In one moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) imagination placed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,
explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and
instantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the room
to inforce, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feet, by the eloquence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) eyes, the assurances
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) letter.  The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.  The
hand writing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother, never till then unwelcome, was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);
and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an
ecstasy of more than hope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt as if, till that instant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
never suffered.

<p/>The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) reach in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could
reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) only by the tears which streamed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) eyes with
passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its
object, that after many expressions of pity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) withdrew, still
referring her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) to the letter of comfort.  But the letter, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was
calm enough to read it, brought little comfort.  Willoughby filled
every page.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother, still confident of their engagement, and
relying as warmly as ever on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) constancy, had only been roused by
Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards
them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), such affection
for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each
other, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wept with agony through the whole of it.

<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) impatience to be at home again now returned; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was
dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) than ever; dearer through the very excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mistaken
confidence in Willoughby, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was wildly urgent to be gone.
Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne
to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own except of
patience till their mother's wishes could be known; and at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
obtained her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's consent to wait for that knowledge.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could not be easy
till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself;
and positively refusing Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for
the rest of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the
pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne's
letter, how ill she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then
sat down to write her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother an account of what had passed, and entreat
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the
drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table
where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pen, grieving over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly
over its effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/>In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when
Marianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was
startled by a rap at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can this be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor.  <div class="bookquote">``So early too! I thought we HAD been
safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne moved to the window--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Colonel Brandon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), with vexation.  <div class="bookquote">``We are never safe
from HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not trust to THAT,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>retreating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own room.  <div class="bookquote">``A man who has
nothing to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own time has no conscience in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intrusion on
that of others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The event proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) conjecture right, though it was founded on
injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, who
was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) thither, and who
saw THAT solicitude in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) disturbed and melancholy look, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
anxious though brief inquiry after her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister
for esteeming him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) so lightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>), after the first
salutation, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) encouraged me to come on; and I was the more
easily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you
alone, which I was very desirous of doing.  My object--my wish--my sole
wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe it is--is to be a means of
giving comfort;--no, I must not say comfort--not present comfort--but
conviction, lasting conviction to your sister's mind.  My regard for
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it, by
relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere
regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being useful--I think I am
justified--though where so many hours have been spent in convincing
myself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be
wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor.  <div class="bookquote">``You have something to tell me of Mr.
Willoughby, that will open his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) character farther.  Your telling it will
be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne.  MY
gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to
that end, and HERS must be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let me
hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,--but
this will give you no idea--I must go farther back.  You will find me a
very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.  A
short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it SHALL be
a short one.  On such a subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>sighing heavily, <div class="bookquote">``can I have little
temptation to be diffuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went
on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation---LRB-it is not to be
supposed that it could make any impression on you-RRB---a conversation
between us one evening at Barton Park--it was the evening of a
dance--in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in
some measure, your sister Marianne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``I have NOT forgotten it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) looked pleased
by this remembrance, and added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender
recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well
in mind as person.  The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of
fancy and spirits.  This lady was one of my nearest relations, an
orphan from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.  Our
ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were
playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the time when I did not
love Eliza; and my affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), as we grew up, was such, as
perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you
might think me incapable of having ever felt.  Hers, for me, was, I
believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and
it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.  At
seventeen she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was lost to me for ever.  She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was married--married
against her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) inclination to my brother.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fortune was large, and our
family estate much encumbered.  And this, I fear, is all that can be
said for the conduct of one, who was at once her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uncle and guardian.
My brother did not deserve her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not even love her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).  I had hoped
that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) regard for me would support her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) under any difficulty, and for
some time it did; but at last the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) situation, for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
experienced great unkindness, overcame all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) resolution, and though
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I relate!  I have
never told you how this was brought on.  We were within a few hours of
eloping together for Scotland.  The treachery, or the folly, of my
cousin's maid betrayed us.  I was banished to the house of a relation
far distant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,
till my father's point was gained.  I had depended on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) fortitude too
far, and the blow was a severe one--but had her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) marriage been happy, so
young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at
least I should not have now to lament it.  This however was not the
case.  My brother had no regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pleasures were not what
they ought to have been, and from the first he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) unkindly.
The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so
inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) resigned
herself at first to all the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) situation; and happy had it
been if she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had not lived to overcome those regrets which the
remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we wonder that, with such a
husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or
restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) -LRB-for my father lived only a few months after their
marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) should
fall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I meant to promote the
happiness of both by removing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) for years, and for that purpose
had procured my exchange.  The shock which her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) marriage had given me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued, in a voice of great agitation, <div class="bookquote">``was of trifling
weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years
afterwards, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) divorce.  It was THAT which threw this gloom,--even
now the recollection of what I suffered--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about
the room.  Elinor, affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) relation, and still more by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
distress, could not speak.  He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) concern, and coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.  A few
minutes more of silent exertion enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to proceed with composure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned
to England.  My first care, when I DID arrive, was of course to seek
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.  I could
not trace her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first seducer, and there was every reason to
fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had removed from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only to sink deeper in a life of
sin.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) legal allowance was not adequate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fortune, nor
sufficient for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my
brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months
before to another person.  He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) imagined, and calmly could he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) imagine it,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to
dispose of it for some immediate relief.  At last, however, and after I
had been six months in England, I DID find her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).  Regard for a former
servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to
visit him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) in a spunging-house, where he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was confined for debt; and
there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate
sister.  So altered--so faded--worn down by acute suffering of every
kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before
me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom
I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--but I have no
right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it--I have
pained you too much already.  That she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, to all appearance, in the
last stage of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was my
greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), beyond giving time
for a better preparation for death; and that was given.  I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) every day during the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) short life: I was with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
last moments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feelings in
an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) unfortunate friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``by the resemblance
I have fancied between her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and my poor disgraced relation.  Their
fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet
disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier
marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might have been all that you will live to see the other
be.  But to what does all this lead?  I seem to have been distressing
you for nothing.  Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched
for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!  I WILL be
more collected--more concise.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) left to my care her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) only child, a
little girl, the offspring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) first guilty connection, who was then
about three years old.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) loved the child, and had always kept it
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>).  It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I
have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I
had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at
school.  I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) there whenever I could, and after the death of my
brother, -LRB-which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the
possession of the family property,-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) visited me at Delaford.  I
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in
general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).  It is now
three years ago -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had just reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) fourteenth year,-RRB- that I
removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) from school, to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) under the care of a very
respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four
or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I
had every reason to be pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) situation.  But last February,
almost a twelvemonth back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) suddenly disappeared.  I had allowed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), -LRB-imprudently, as it has since turned out,-RRB- at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) earnest desire,
to go to Bath with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) young friends, who was attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)
father there for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) health.  I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be a very good sort of man,
and I thought well of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter--better than she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) deserved, for, with
a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would tell nothing, would
give no clue, though she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) certainly knew all.  He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, a
well-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,
give no information; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been generally confined to the house,
while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance
they chose; and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was
convinced himself, of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the
business.  In short, I could learn nothing but that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was gone; all
the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.  What I
thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``could it be--could Willoughby!'' (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The first news that reached me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``came in a
letter from herself, last October.  It was forwarded to me from
Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party
to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,

and which I believe gave offence to some.  Little did Mr. Willoughby
imagine, I suppose, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) looks censured me for incivility in
breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had made poor and miserable; but HAD he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) known it, what would it have
availed?  Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of
your sister?  No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had already done that, which no man who CAN feel
for another would do.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left the girl whose youth and innocence
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no
creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) address!  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), promising to return; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neither returned, nor wrote, nor

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than
both.  Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what
I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as ever, and on
being assured that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): guess what I must have felt
for all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and found you alone,
I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when
it WAS known.  My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but
now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be so deceived; to
see your sister--but what could I do?  I had no hope of interfering
with success; and sometimes I thought your sister's influence might yet
reclaim him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what
were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) designs on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).  Whatever they may have been, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may
now, and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own
condition, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)
considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and
pictures her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to herself, with an affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so strong, still as
strong as her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which
must attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) through life.  Surely this comparison must have its use
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) will feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own sufferings to be nothing.  They
proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.  On the
contrary, every friend must be made still more her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) friend by them.
Concern for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) unhappiness, and respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) fortitude under it,
must strengthen every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however, in
communicating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) what I have told you.  You must know best what
will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed
it might be of service, might lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) regrets, I would not have
suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family
afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been intended to
raise myself at the expense of others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;
attended too with the assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expecting material advantage to
Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been more pained,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) endeavors to acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
than by all the rest; for it irritates her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind more than the most
perfect conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) unworthiness can do.  Now, though at first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) will suffer much, I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) will soon become easier.  Have
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) continued, after a short silence, <div class="bookquote">``ever seen Mr. Willoughby
since you left him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) at Barton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) replied gravely, <div class="bookquote">``once I have.  One meeting was unavoidable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, startled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) manner, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) anxiously, saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? have you met him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) no other way.  Eliza had confessed to me, though most
reluctantly, the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) lover; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) returned to town, which
was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to
defend, I to punish his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) conduct.  We returned unwounded, and the
meeting, therefore, never got abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a
soldier she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) presumed not to censure it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``has been the unhappy
resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so imperfectly
have I discharged my trust!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brandon/Mrs. Brandon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) still in town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lying-in, for I found her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) near
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) delivery, I removed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) child into the country, and there
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) remains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was probably dividing Elinor
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) put an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) visit, receiving from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) again
the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) full of compassion
and esteem for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER 32


<p/>When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss
Dashwood to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was
not entirely such as the former had hoped to see.  Not that Marianne
appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) listened to
it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither
objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and
seemed to shew by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tears that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt it to be impossible.  But
though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt
WAS carried home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw with satisfaction the
effect of it, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) called,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of
compassionate respect, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits less violently
irritated than before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) less wretched.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind did
become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt the
loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had felt the
loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) heart; his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the
misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) designs might ONCE
have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) spirits, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) could not bring herself to speak of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) felt even to Elinor;
and, brooding over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister
than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent
confession of them.

<p/>To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and
answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly
less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than
Elinor's.  Long letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), quickly succeeding each other,
arrived to tell all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) suffered and thought; to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would bear up with
fortitude under this misfortune.  Bad indeed must the nature of
Marianne's affliction be, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother could talk of fortitude!
mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which
SHE could wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not to indulge!

<p/>Against the interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had
determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at
that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) view would be
bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by
constantly placing Willoughby before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had always seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) there.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) recommended it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) daughters, therefore, by all
means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which,
though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at
least five or six weeks.  A variety of occupations, of objects, and of
company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable
there, and might yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some
interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the
ideas of both might now be spurned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).

<p/>From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
friends.  Design could never bring them in each other's way: negligence
could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in
its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of
Barton, where it might force him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) while paying that visit at
Allenham on his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first
as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had yet another reason for wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) children to remain where
they were; a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) son-in-law had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>)
wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) judged
it right that they should sometimes see their brother.

<p/>Marianne had promised to be guided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother's opinion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved
perfectly different from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wished and expected, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt
it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by
requiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) longer continuance in London it deprived her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) of the only
possible alleviation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother, and doomed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to such society and such scenes as must prevent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ever knowing a moment's rest.

<p/>But it was a matter of great consolation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), that what brought evil
to herself would bring good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister; and Elinor, on the other
hand, suspecting that it would not be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) power to avoid Edward
entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay
would therefore militate against her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own happiness, it would be better
for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) carefulness in guarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister from ever hearing Willoughby's
name mentioned, was not thrown away.  Marianne, though without knowing
it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor
Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) before her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>).
Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards
herself, but that was impossible, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was obliged to listen day
after day to the indignation of them all.

<p/>Sir John, could not have thought it possible.  <div class="bookquote">``A man of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
always had such reason to think well!  Such a good-natured fellow!  He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
did not believe there was a bolder rider in England!  It was an
unaccountable business.  He (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) at the devil with all his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) heart.
He (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) would not speak another word to him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>), meet him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) might, for
all the world!  No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,
and they were kept watching for two hours together.  Such a scoundrel
of a fellow! such a deceitful dog!  It was only the last time they met
that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had offered him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) one of Folly's puppies! and this was the end of
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Palmer, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) way, was equally angry.  <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was determined to
drop his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) acquaintance immediately, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was very thankful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
had never been acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at all.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wished with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,
for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) so much
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was resolved never to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) name again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) should
tell everybody she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) saw, how good-for-nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer/Palmer</b></font>)</div><p/>The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the
particulars in her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) power of the approaching marriage, and communicating
them to Elinor.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could soon tell at what coachmaker's the new
carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait was
drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be seen.

<p/>The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a
happy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as they often were by the
clamorous kindness of the others.  It was a great comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be
sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle
of friends: a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's health.

<p/>Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the
moment, to more than its real value; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was sometimes worried down
by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to
comfort than good-nature.

<p/>Lady Middleton expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) sense of the affair about once every day,
or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, <div class="bookquote">``It is very
shocking, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton/Middleton</b></font>)</div>and by the means of this continual though gentle
vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first
without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without
recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the
dignity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own sex, and spoken her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) decided censure of what was
wrong in the other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) thought herself at liberty to attend to the
interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own assemblies, and therefore determined -LRB-though rather
against the opinion of Sir John-RRB- that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once
be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) card with her (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) as soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) married.

<p/>Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome
to Miss Dashwood.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate
discussion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with
confidence.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing
past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye
with which Marianne sometimes observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), and the gentleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
voice whenever -LRB-though it did not often happen-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was obliged, or
could oblige herself to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).  THESE assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and
THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but
Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the
Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could neither prevail
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to make the offer himself, nor commission her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) to make it for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of
Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of
a week that it would not be a match at all.  The good understanding
between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the
honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all
be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to
think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.

<p/>Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's
letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
was married.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to
herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from
the public papers, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eagerly examining every morning.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on
it, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would burst
out, and for the rest of the day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was in a state hardly less
pitiable than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) first learnt to expect the event.

<p/>The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now
hoped, as there could be no danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) seeing either of them, to
prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow
first fell, to go out again by degrees as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had done before.

<p/>About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin's
house in Bartlett's Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again
before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and
were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.

<p/>Elinor only was sorry to see them.  Their presence always gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
pain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the
overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) STILL in town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here
STILL,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word.  <div class="bookquote">``But
I always thought I SHOULD.  I was almost sure you would not leave
London yet awhile; though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you
should not stay above a MONTH.  But I thought, at the time, that you
would most likely change your mind when it came to the point.  It would
have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and
sister came.  And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.  I
am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor perfectly understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and was forced to use all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
self-command to make it appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did NOT.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, <div class="bookquote">``and how did you travel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the stage, I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Steele, with quick
exultation; <div class="bookquote">``we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to
attend us.  Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we'd join
him (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) in a post-chaise; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or
twelve shillings more than we did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jennings; <div class="bookquote">``very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is
a single man, I warrant you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, <div class="bookquote">``everybody laughs
at me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why.  My cousins say they
are sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never
think about him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) from one hour's end to another.  `Lord! here comes your
beau, Nancy,' my cousin said t`other day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) crossing the
street to the house.  My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who you
mean.  The Doctor is no beau of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won't do--the Doctor is
the man, I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) cousin, with affected earnestness, <div class="bookquote">``and I beg
you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Jennings directly gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) the gratifying assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss
Dashwood, when they come to town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, returning, after a
cessation of hostile hints, to the charge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I do not think we shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I dare say you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor would not humour her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) by farther opposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for
so long a time together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Long a time, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Jennings.  <div class="bookquote">``Why, their visit is
but just begun!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy was silenced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Steele.  <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) is not well--''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>for Marianne had left the room
on their arrival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good.  My sister will be equally sorry to miss the
pleasure of seeing you; but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has been very much plagued lately with
nervous head-aches, which make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) unfit for company or conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and
me!--I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might see US; and I am sure we would not speak a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister was
perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dressing gown, and therefore
not able to come to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Steele, <div class="bookquote">``we can just as well go and see
HER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) temper; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy's sharp reprimand, which
now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness to the
manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the other.



<p/>CHAPTER 33


<p/>After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's entreaties, and
consented to go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an
hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and
would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in Sackville Street,
where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few
old-fashioned jewels of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/>When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was
a lady at the other end of the street on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) ought to call; and as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) young
friends transacted their's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) should pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) visit and return for
them.

<p/>On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before
them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to
their orders; and they were obliged to wait.  All that could be done
was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the
quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is
probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) politeness to
a quicker despatch.  But the correctness of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye, and the delicacy
of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) taste, proved to be beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) politeness.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was giving orders
for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and
ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debating
for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were
finally arranged by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own inventive fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had no leisure to
bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised
in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to
imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong,
natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of
fashion.

<p/>Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and
resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on
the puppyism of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) manner in deciding on all the different horrors of
the different toothpick-cases presented to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inspection, by remaining
unconscious of it all; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was as well able to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thoughts
within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), in
Mr. Gray's shop, as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own bedroom.

<p/>At last the affair was decided.  The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,
all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last
day on which his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) existence could be continued without the possession of
the toothpick-case, drew on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloves with leisurely care, and
bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as
seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a
happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.

<p/>Elinor lost no time in bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) business forward, was on the point
of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) side.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes towards his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with some surprise
to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother.

<p/>Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very
creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop.  John Dashwood was really far
from being sorry to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) sisters again; it rather gave them
satisfaction; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) inquiries after their mother were respectful and
attentive.

<p/>Elinor found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) and Fanny had been in town two days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but it was
impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at
Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.
Harry was vastly pleased.  THIS morning I had fully intended to call on
you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so
much to do on first coming to town.  I am come here to bespeak Fanny a
seal.  But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in
Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.  I
understand she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is a woman of very good fortune.  And the Middletons
too, you must introduce me to THEM.  As my mother-in-law's relations, I
shall be happy to show them every respect.  They are excellent
neighbours to you in the country, I understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent indeed.  Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness
in every particular, is more than I can express.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed.
But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are
related to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to
make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected.  And so you
are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for
nothing!  Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the
most complete thing of its kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, that ever was, and you all
seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing.  It was a great satisfaction to us
to hear it, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother; and was not sorry to
be spared the necessity of answering him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), by the arrival of Mrs.
Jennings's servant, who came to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) mistress waited for
them at the door.

<p/>Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings
at the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) carriage, and repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hope of being able to
call on them the next day, took leave.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) visit was duly paid.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) came with a pretence at an apology from
their sister-in-law, for not coming too; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) was so much engaged
with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) mother, that really she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) had no leisure for going any where.''
 (<font color='red'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) directly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) should not stand
upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
sisters to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>).  His (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly
kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel
Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) with a curiosity
which seemed to say, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) only wanted to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to be rich, to be
equally civil to HIM.

<p/>After staying with them half an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) asked Elinor to walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
to Conduit Street, and introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to Sir John and Lady Middleton.
The weather was remarkably fine, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) readily consented.  As soon as
they were out of the house, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) enquiries began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is Colonel Brandon?  Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) a man of fortune?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has very good property in Dorsetshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,
Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable
establishment in life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me, brother! what do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) likes you.  I observed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) narrowly, and am convinced of it.  What
is the amount of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fortune?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe about two thousand a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two thousand a-year;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then working himself up to a pitch of
enthusiastic generosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Elinor, I wish with all my heart it
were TWICE as much, for your sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``but I am very sure that
Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken.  A very little
trouble on your side secures him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).  Perhaps just at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) may be
undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hang back; his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
friends may all advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) against it.  But some of those little
attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), in spite of himself.  And there can be no reason why you should
not try for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).  It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on
your side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is
quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you have
too much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon must be the man;
and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) pleased with
you and your family.  It is a match that must give universal
satisfaction.  In short, it is a kind of thing that'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
voice to an important whisper--<div class="bookquote">``will be exceedingly welcome to ALL
PARTIES.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Recollecting himself, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``That is, I mean to
say--your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny
particularly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has your interest very much at heart, I assure
you.  And her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am
sure it would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) great pleasure; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said as much the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be something remarkable, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``something
droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the
same time.  And yet it is not very unlikely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, with resolution, <div class="bookquote">``going to be
married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) has a most excellent mother.  Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost
liberality, will come forward, and settle on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) a thousand a year, if
the match takes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter
of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.  A very desirable
connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in
time.  A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to
make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give you
another instance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) liberality:--The other day, as soon as we came
to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) put bank-notes into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred
pounds.  And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great
expense while we are here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) paused for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) assent and compassion; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) forced herself to say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable;
but your income is a large one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.  I do not mean to
complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will
in time be better.  The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,
is a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little purchase within
this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where
old Gibson used to live.  The land was so very desirable for me in
every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it
my duty to buy it.  I could not have answered it to my conscience to
let it fall into any other hands.  A man must pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) convenience;
and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again, the next day, for
more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have
been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,
that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's
hands, I must have sold out to very great loss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could only smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to
Norland.  Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the
Stanhill effects that remained at Norland -LRB-and very valuable they were-RRB-
to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doing so; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had an
undoubted right to dispose of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own property as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chose, but, in
consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of
linen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away.  You may
guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being
rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's kindness is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``and assisted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) liberality, I hope you
may yet live to be in easy circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another year or two may do much towards it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) gravely replied; <div class="bookquote">``but
however there is still a great deal to be done.  There is not a stone
laid of Fanny's green-house, and nothing but the plan of the
flower-garden marked out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the green-house to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old walnut trees are all come
down to make room for it.  It will be a very fine object from many
parts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before
it, and be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old thorns
that grew in patches over the brow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) concern and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) censure to herself; and was very
thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.

<p/>Having now said enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) poverty clear, and to do away the
necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
next visit at Gray's his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) began
to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) style of
living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintance
that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may
prove materially advantageous.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) inviting you to town is certainly a
vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a
regard for you, that in all probability when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) dies you will not be
forgotten.-- She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) must have a great deal to leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) has only her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
jointure, which will descend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is not to be imagined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) lives up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) income.  Few
people of common prudence will do THAT; and whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) saves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
will be able to dispose of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you not think it more likely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) should leave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
daughters, than to us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I
cannot perceive the necessity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) remembering them farther.
Whereas, in my opinion, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) taking so much notice of you, and
treating you in this kind of way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) has given you a sort of claim on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not
disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) behaviour; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) can
hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) raises none in those most concerned.  Indeed, brother, your
anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), seeming to recollect himself, <div class="bookquote">``people have
little, have very little in their power.  But, my dear Elinor, what is
the matter with Marianne?-- she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) looks very unwell, has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) colour,
and is grown quite thin.  Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is not well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has had a nervous complaint on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) for several
weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for that.  At her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) time of life, any thing of an illness
destroys the bloom for ever!  Hers has been a very short one!  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was
as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to
attract the man.  There was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) style of beauty, to please
them particularly.  I remember Fanny used to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would marry
sooner and better than you did; not but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is exceedingly fond of
YOU, but so it happened to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will be mistaken, however.
I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than five
or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if
YOU do not do better.  Dorsetshire!  I know very little of Dorsetshire;
but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;
and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the
earliest and best pleased of your visitors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor tried very seriously to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that there was no
likelihood of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation
of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was really
resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the
marriage by every possible attention.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had just compunction enough
for having done nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) sisters himself, to be exceedingly
anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from
Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means
of atoning for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own neglect.

<p/>They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John
came in before their visit ended.  Abundance of civilities passed on
all sides.  Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood
did not seem to know much about horses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) soon set him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) down as a very
good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
appearance to think his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood
went away delighted with both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
walked back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister.  <div class="bookquote">``Lady Middleton is really a most elegant
woman!  Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.  And Mrs.
Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant
as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter.  Your sister need not have any scruple even of
visiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and
very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a
man who had got all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars
were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) daughters
were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with.  But now
I can carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a most satisfactory account of both.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 34


<p/>Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband's judgment,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
daughter; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,
even the woman with whom her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sisters were staying, by no means unworthy
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) one of the most
charming women in the world!

<p/>Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.  There was a
kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually
attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid
propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.

<p/>The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the
good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings,
and to HER she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman
of uncordial address, who met her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's sisters without any
affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of
the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat at least
seven minutes and a half in silence.

<p/>Elinor wanted very much to know, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not chuse to ask,
whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny
voluntarily to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) name before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), till able to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband's
expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed
them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be
too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.  The
intelligence however, which SHE would not give, soon flowed from
another quarter.  Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassion
on being unable to see Edward, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had arrived in town with Mr.
and Mrs. Dashwood.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear
of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be
told, they could do nothing at present but write.

<p/>Edward assured them himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) being in town, within a very short
time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.  Twice was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) card found on
the table, when they returned from their morning's engagements.  Elinor
was pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had called; and still more pleased that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had
missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/>The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that,
though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to
give them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited
them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house
for three months.  Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited
likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,
always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eager
civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.  They were to
meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sons were to
be of the party.  The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) interested in the engagement; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could now meet
Edward's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to
attend such an introduction, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could now see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with perfect
indifference as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion of herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) desire of being in
company with Mrs. Ferrars, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) curiosity to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was like, was
as lively as ever.

<p/>The interest with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) thus anticipated the party, was soon
afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) hearing
that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.

<p/>So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable
had their assiduities made them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>), that though Lucy was certainly
not so elegant, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sister not even genteel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was as ready as
Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it
happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as
the Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their visit should begin a
few days before the party took place.

<p/>Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the
gentleman who for many years had had the care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) brother, might not
have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) table; but
as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long
wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of
their characters and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own difficulties, and to have an opportunity
of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) life,
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.

<p/>On Elinor its effect was very different.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) began immediately to
determine, that Edward who lived with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother, must be asked as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mother was, to a party given by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister; and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for the
first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hardly
knew how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could bear it!

<p/>These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and
certainly not at all on truth.  They were relieved however, not by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to
be inflicting a severe disappointment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that Edward
certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to
be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was kept
away by the extreme affection for herself, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could not conceal
when they were together.

<p/>The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies
to this formidable mother-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs
together--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,
that they all followed the servant at the same time--<div class="bookquote">``There is nobody
here but you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.
Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my
happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!'' (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Elinor could have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediate relief by suggesting the
possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own,
whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) assured
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and with great sincerity, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did pity her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--to the utter
amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at
least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.

<p/>Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) aspect.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
complexion was sallow; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) features small, without beauty, and
naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had
rescued her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it
the strong characters of pride and ill nature.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was not a woman of
many words; for, unlike people in general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) proportioned them to the
number of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), not
one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eyed with the spirited
determination of disliking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) at all events.

<p/>Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few months
ago it would have hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars'
power to distress her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) by it now;--and the difference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) manners to
the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humble
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) more, only amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) could not but smile to see the
graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- for
Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others, had they known
as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did, they would have been most anxious to mortify; while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat
pointedly slighted by both.  But while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) smiled at a graciousness so
misapplied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which
it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss
Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all
four.

<p/>Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss
Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.

<p/>The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every thing
bespoke the Mistress's inclination for show, and the Master's ability
to support it.  In spite of the improvements and additions which were
making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having once
been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a
loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had tried to
infer from it;--no poverty of any kind, except of conversation,
appeared--but there, the deficiency was considerable.  John Dashwood
had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) wife
had still less.  But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it was
very much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all
laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being
agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want of
elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.

<p/>When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty
was particularly evident, for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse
with some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land, and
breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only engaged
the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative heights of
Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William, who were
nearly of the same age.

<p/>Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determined
too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, it
was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a right
to be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over
again as often as they liked.

<p/>The parties stood thus:

<p/>The two mothers, though each really convinced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own son was the
tallest, politely decided in favour of the other.

<p/>The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity,
were equally earnest in support of their own descendant.

<p/>Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,
thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not
conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world
between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as
fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) could, in favour of each.

<p/>Elinor, having once delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion on William's side, by which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the
necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when
called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had no
opinion to give, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had never thought about it.

<p/>Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair
of screens for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and
brought home, ornamented her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) present drawing room; and these screens,
catching the eye of John Dashwood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) following the other gentlemen
into the room, were officiously handed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to Colonel Brandon for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are done by my eldest sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and you, as a man of
taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.  I do not know whether
you have ever happened to see any of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) performances before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
is in general reckoned to draw extremely well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,
warmly admired the screens, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would have done any thing painted by
Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course
excited, they were handed round for general inspection.  Mrs. Ferrars,
not aware of their being Elinor's work, particularly requested to look
at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady
Middletons's approbation, Fanny presented them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother,
considerately informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), at the same time, that they were done by
Miss Dashwood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ferrars/Robert/Mrs. Robert Ferrars</b></font>)</div>--said Mrs. Ferrars--<div class="bookquote">``very pretty,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ferrars/Robert/Mrs. Robert Ferrars</b></font>)</div>--and without regarding them at
all, returned them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) daughter.

<p/>Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother had been quite rude
enough,--for, colouring a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) immediately said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But then again, the dread of
having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) presently added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton's style of
painting, Ma'am?--She (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifully
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) last landscape is done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautifully indeed!  But SHE does every thing well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne could not bear this.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was already greatly displeased with
Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor's
expense, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not any notion of what was principally meant by
it, provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediately to say with warmth,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is admiration of a very particular kind!--what is Miss Morton to
us?--who knows, or who cares, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>)?--it is Elinor of whom WE think
and speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And so saying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) took the screens out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law's hands,
to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.

<p/>Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more
stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, <div class="bookquote">``Miss
Morton is Lord Morton's daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ferrars/Robert/Mrs. Robert Ferrars</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny looked very angry too, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband was all in a fright at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
sister's audacity.  Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they
were fixed on Marianne, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) noticed only what was amiable
in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister
slighted in the smallest point.

<p/>Marianne's feelings did not stop here.  The cold insolence of Mrs.
Ferrars's general behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) sister, seemed, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), to foretell
such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own wounded heart
taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of
affectionate sensibility, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) moved after a moment, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's
chair, and putting one arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) neck, and one cheek close to hers,
said in a low, but eager, voice,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them.  Don't let them make YOU unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could say no more; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
face on Elinor's shoulder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) burst into tears.  Every body's
attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.--Colonel
Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did.--Mrs.
Jennings, with a very intelligent <div class="bookquote">``Ah! poor dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>immediately gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author
of this nervous distress, that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) instantly changed his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) seat to one
close by Lucy Steele, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>), in a whisper, a brief account of
the whole shocking affair.

<p/>In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end
to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits retained
the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Marianne!''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could secure his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) attention,-- <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has not such good
health as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is very nervous,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has not Elinor's
constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying
to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) personal
attractions.  You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS
remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--
Now you see it is all gone.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 35


<p/>Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had found
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between
the families undesirable.-- She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pride, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
meanness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend
all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and
retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) been otherwise
free;--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen almost enough to be thankful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) OWN sake,
that one greater obstacle preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) from suffering under any other
of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) from all dependence upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
caprice, or any solicitude for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) good opinion.  Or at least, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being fettered to
Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) OUGHT to
have rejoiced.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the
civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) interest and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) vanity should so
very much blind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) as to make the attention which seemed only paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow
her (<font color='blue'><b>ELINOR</b></font>) to derive encouragement from a preference only given her (<font color='blue'><b>ELINOR</b></font>), because
her (<font color='blue'><b>ELINOR</b></font>) real situation was unknown.  But that it was so, had not only been
declared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over again the
next morning more openly, for at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) particular desire, Lady Middleton
set her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,
to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was.

<p/>The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, <div class="bookquote">``I
come to talk to you of my happiness.  Could anything be so flattering
as Mrs. Ferrars's way of treating me yesterday?  So exceeding affable
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>);--but
the very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
behaviour as really should seem to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had quite took a fancy to
me.  Now was not it so?-- You saw it all; and was not you quite struck
with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was certainly very civil to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal
more.  Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride,
no hauteur, and your sister just the same--all sweetness and
affability!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to
own that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go
on.--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``nothing
could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was
not the case'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guessed you would say so,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--replied Lucy quickly--<div class="bookquote">``but there was no
reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) did
not, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) liking me is every thing.  You shan't talk me out of my
satisfaction.  I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no
difficulties at all, to what I used to think.  Mrs. Ferrars is a
charming woman, and so is your sister.  They are both delightful women,
indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.
Dashwood was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you don't speak;--sure you
an't well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was in better health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it.  I
should be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have been the greatest
comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done
without your friendship.'' (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own success.
But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) directly replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to
Edward's love, it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But
now there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty
often, for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall
be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister--besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will
visit now;--and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say
more than once, they should always be glad to see me.-- They are such
charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), you cannot speak too high.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But Elinor would not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) any encouragement to hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) SHOULD
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.  Lucy continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took
a dislike to me.  If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had only made me a formal courtesy, for
instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of
me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I mean--if
I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave
it all up in despair.  I could not have stood it.  For where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) DOES
dislike, I know it is most violent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by
the door's being thrown open, the servant's announcing Mr. Ferrars, and
Edward's immediately walking in.

<p/>It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each shewed that
it was so.  They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to
have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to
advance farther into it.  The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest
form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallen
on them.--They were not only all three together, but were together
without the relief of any other person.  The ladies recovered
themselves first.  It was not Lucy's business to put herself forward,
and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could
therefore only LOOK her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tenderness, and after slightly addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>),
said no more.

<p/>But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) sake and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
own, to do it well, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) forced herself, after a moment's
recollection, to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>), with a look and manner that were almost
easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still
improved them.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the
consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) from
saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was happy to see him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had very much
regretted being from home, when he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) called before in Berkeley Street.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would not be frightened from paying him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) those attentions which, as
a friend and almost a relation, were his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) due, by the observant eyes of
Lucy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had courage enough
to sit down; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in
a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sex might
make it rare; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor
could his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.

<p/>Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no
contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;
and almost every thing that WAS said, proceeded from Elinor, who was
obliged to volunteer all the information about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's health,
their coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,
but never did.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exertions did not stop here; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) soon afterwards felt herself
so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching
Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) really did it, and
THAT in the handsomest manner, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) loitered away several minutes on
the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister.  When that was once done, however, it was time for the
raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) into the
drawing-room immediately.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) pleasure in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was like every
other of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) met
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the
affection of a sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Edward!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``this is a moment of great happiness!--This
would almost make amends for every thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Edward tried to return her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) kindness as it deserved, but before such
witnesses he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dared not say half what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really felt.  Again they all
sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was
looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and
sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other
should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence.  Edward was the first
to speak, and it was to notice Marianne's altered looks, and express
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not finding London agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't think of me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) replied with spirited earnestness, though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes were filled with tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``don't think of MY
health.  Elinor is well, you see.  That must be enough for us both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor
to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no
very benignant expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like London?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div>said Edward, willing to say any thing that might
introduce another subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.
The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and
thank Heaven! you are what you always were!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) paused--no one spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) presently added, <div class="bookquote">``we must employ Edward to take
care of us in our return to Barton.  In a week or two, I suppose, we
shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to
accept the charge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even
himself.  But Marianne, who saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) agitation, and could easily trace
it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and
soon talked of something else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday!  So dull, so
wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head, which
cannot be said now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And with this admirable discretion did she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) defer the assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
being particularly disgusted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother, till they were more in
private.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you not come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was engaged elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Engaged!  But what was that, when such friends were to be met?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, Miss Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no
mind to keep them, little as well as great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the
sting; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) calmly replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that
conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.  And I really believe
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous
in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) interest or pleasure.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is the most fearful of giving
pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish,
of any body I ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.  What!
are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be no friend of
mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to
my open commendation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) commendation, in the present case, however, happened
to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) very soon
got up to go away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going so soon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne; <div class="bookquote">``my dear Edward, this must not be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>And drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) a little aside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) persuasion that Lucy
could not stay much longer.  But even this encouragement failed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
would go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) visit lasted
two hours, soon afterwards went away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) here so often?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) leaving them.
<div class="bookquote">``Could not she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) see that we wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) gone!--how teazing to Edward!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?--we were all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) friends, and Lucy has been the longest known
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) of any.  It is but natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) as
well as ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) steadily, and said, <div class="bookquote">``You know, Elinor, that this
is a kind of talking which I cannot bear.  If you only hope to have
your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you
ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it.  I
cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really
wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to say more,
for bound as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) promise of secrecy to Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could give
no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the
consequences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) still continuing in an error might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was
obliged to submit to it.  All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could hope, was that Edward
would not often expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) or himself to the distress of hearing
Marianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of
the pain that had attended their recent meeting--and this she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had every
reason to expect.



<p/>CHAPTER 36


<p/>Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the
world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a
son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least
to all those intimate connections who knew it before.

<p/>This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a
temporary alteration in the disposal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) time, and influenced, in a
like degree, the engagements of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) young friends; for as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wished to
be as much as possible with Charlotte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went thither every morning as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was dressed, and did not return till late in the evening;
and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the Middletons,
spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their own comfort
they would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs.
Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes
of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and
the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as little
valued, as it was professedly sought.

<p/>They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and
by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on
THEIR ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.
Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to
Elinor and Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not really like them at all.  Because they
neither flattered herself nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) children, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not believe them
good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fancied them
satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;
but THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common use, and easily
given.

<p/>Their presence was a restraint both on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) and on Lucy.  It checked the
idleness of one, and the business of the other.  Lady Middleton was
ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was
proud to think of and administer at other times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feared they would
despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the
three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) to
it entirely.  Would either of them only have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) a full and
minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the
best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned.
But this conciliation was not granted; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) often threw out
expressions of pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt
a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was
produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in
the latter.  An effort even yet lighter might have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) their
friend.  Would they only have laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) about the Doctor!  But so
little were they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), that
if Sir John dined from home, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might spend a whole day without
hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was kind
enough to bestow on herself.

<p/>All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally
unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thought it a delightful thing
for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) young
friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old
woman so long.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes at
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own house; but wherever it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always came in excellent
spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte's well
doing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.
One thing DID disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>); and of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) daily complaint.
Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) sex,
of all infants being alike; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) could plainly perceive, at
different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and
every one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) relations on both sides, there was no convincing his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
father of it; no persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to believe that it was not exactly like
every other baby of the same age; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) even be brought to
acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the
world.

<p/>I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time
befell Mrs. John Dashwood.  It so happened that while her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) two sisters
with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) in Harley Street, another
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself not
apparently likely to produce evil to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>).  But while the imaginations
of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our
conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness
must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.  In the present
instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fancy to so far outrun
truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss
Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this
misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of
invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small
musical party at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) house.  The consequence of which was, that Mrs.
John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great
inconvenience of sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what
was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing
to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not
expect to go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) a second time?  The power of disappointing
them, it was true, must always be hers.  But that was not enough; for
when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be
wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from
them.

<p/>Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of
going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went or not: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) prepared quietly and mechanically
for every evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest
amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till the last
moment, where it was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dress and appearance she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was grown so perfectly indifferent, as
not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of
their being together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute
observation and general curiosity; she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) saw every thing, and asked every
thing; was never easy till she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) knew the price of every part of
Marianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) gowns altogether
with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not without hopes
of finding out before they parted, how much her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) washing cost per week,
and how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had every year to spend upon herself.  The
impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally
concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was
considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after
undergoing an examination into the value and make of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) gown, the
colour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) shoes, and the arrangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was almost
sure of being told that upon <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) word she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) looked vastly smart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
dared to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would make a great many conquests.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With such encouragement as this, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dismissed on the present
occasion, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brother's carriage; which they were ready to enter
five minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very
agreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house of
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part
that might inconvenience either herself or her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) coachman.

<p/>The events of this evening were not very remarkable.  The party, like
other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real
taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;
and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,
and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in
England.

<p/>As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) made no
scruple of turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it
suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and
violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the
room.  In one of these excursive glances she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) perceived among a group of
young men, the very he (<font color='blue'><b>performers</b></font>), who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases
at Gray's.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) soon afterwards looking at herself, and
speaking familiarly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother; and had just determined to find out
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) name from the latter, when they both came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and Mr.
Dashwood introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as Mr. Robert Ferrars.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with easy civility, and twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) head into a bow
which assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as plainly as words could have done, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was
exactly the coxcomb she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) described to be by Lucy.  Happy
had it been for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), if her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) regard for Edward had depended less on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
own merit, than on the merit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) nearest relations!  For then his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
brother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the
ill-humour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother and sister would have begun.  But while she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
wondered at the difference of the two young men, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not find that
the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) out of all charity with
the modesty and worth of the other.  Why they WERE different, Robert
exclaimed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) himself in the course of a quarter of an hour's
conversation; for, talking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brother, and lamenting the extreme
GAUCHERIE which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really believed kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) from mixing in proper
society, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) candidly and generously attributed it much less to any
natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) himself, though probably without any particular, any material
superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,
was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I believe it is nothing more; and so I often
tell my mother, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is grieving about it.  `My dear Madam,' I
always say to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), `you must make yourself easy.  The evil is now
irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would you
be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to
place Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
life?  If you had only sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to Westminster as well as myself,
instead of sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been
prevented.' This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and
my mother is perfectly convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) error.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor would not oppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) opinion, because, whatever might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not
think of Edward's abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You reside in Devonshire, I think,'' (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>--was his (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) next observation, <div class="bookquote">``in a
cottage near Dawlish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor set him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) right as to its situation; and it seemed rather
surprising to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living
near Dawlish.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) bestowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) hearty approbation however on their
species of house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my own part,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>), ``I am excessively fond of a cottage; there
is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them.  And I protest,
if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one
myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself
down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy.  I
advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage.  My friend
Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,
and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's.  I was to decide
on the best of them.  `My dear Courtland,' said I, immediately throwing
them all into the fire, `do not adopt either of them, but by all means
build a cottage.' And that I fancy, will be the end of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a
cottage; but this is all a mistake.  I was last month at my friend
Elliott's, near Dartford.  Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  `But
how can it be done?' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliott</b></font>); `my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is
to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten
couple, and where can the supper be?' I immediately saw that there
could be no difficulty in it, so I said, `My dear Lady Elliott, do not
be uneasy.  The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;
card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open
for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the
saloon.'  Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought.  We measured the
dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the
affair was arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact, you
see, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as
well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor agreed to it all, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) deserved the
compliment of rational opposition.

<p/>As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eldest sister,
his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a thought
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) during the evening, which he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) communicated to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wife, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) approbation, when they got home.  The consideration of Mrs.
Dennison's mistake, in supposing his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sisters their guests, had
suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,
while Mrs. Jennings's engagements kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) from home.  The expense would
be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an
attention which the delicacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) conscience pointed out to be
requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
father.  Fanny was startled at the proposal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not see how it can be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``without affronting Lady
Middleton, for they spend every day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); otherwise I should be
exceedingly glad to do it.  You know I am always ready to pay them any
attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.  But
they are Lady Middleton's visitors.  How can I ask them away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
objection.  <div class="bookquote">``They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit
Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the
same number of days to such near relations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.
But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a
few days with us.  They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and
I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very well
by Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but the
Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.  I am sure you will like
them; indeed, you DO like them, you know, very much already, and so
does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) saw the necessity of inviting the Miss
Steeles immediately, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) conscience was pacified by the resolution
of inviting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly
suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by
bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife, and Marianne as
THEIR visitor.

<p/>Fanny, rejoicing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) escape, and proud of the ready wit that had
procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) company and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sister's, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady
Middleton could spare them.  This was enough to make Lucy really and
reasonably happy.  Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>),
herself; cherishing all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hopes, and promoting all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) views!  Such
an opportunity of being with Edward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) family was, above all
things, the most material to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) interest, and such an invitation the
most gratifying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feelings!  It was an advantage that could not be
too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the
visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits,
was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days'
time.

<p/>When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after
its arrival, it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for the first time, some share in the
expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed
on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arose from something more than merely malice against
herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing
that Lucy wished.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady
Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John
Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of
greater.

<p/>The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor
of their influence there, strengthened her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expectation of the event.
Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts
of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking.  Mrs.
Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
life, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was with them; had given each of them a needle book made
by some emigrant; called Lucy by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) Christian name; and did not know
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should ever be able to part with them.

<p/>CHAPTER 37


<p/>Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) mother felt
it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) time to her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>); and,
contenting herself with visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) once or twice a day, returned from
that period to her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own home, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own habits, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) found the
Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.

<p/>About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in
Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) ordinary visit to
Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by
herself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to
hear something wonderful; and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) time only to form that idea,
began directly to justify it, by saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am.  What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr.
Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
sure it was very ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.
So I looked at it directly, and, `Lord! my dear,' says I, `it is
nothing in the world, but the red gum--' and nurse said just the same.
But Charlotte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for;
and luckily he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>)
stepped over directly, and as soon as ever Mama, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) said
just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and
then Charlotte was easy.  And so, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) was going away again, it
came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of
it, but it came into my head to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) if there was any news.  So upon
that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know
something or other, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) said in a whisper, `For fear any
unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to
their sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I
believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will
do very well.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! is Fanny ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I said, my dear.  `Lord!' says I, `is Mrs.
Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the long and the short of
the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars,
the very young man I used to joke with you about -LRB-but however, as it
turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it-RRB-, Mr.
Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my
cousin Lucy!--There's for you, my dear!--And not a creature knowing a
syllable of the matter, except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a
thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another;
but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody
suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together,
or I am sure I should have found it out directly.  Well, and so this
was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) nor
your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--till this very
morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no
conjurer, popt it all out.  `Lord!' thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) to herself, `they are
all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;'
and so, away she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had just been
saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought to
make a match between Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget
who.  So you may think what a blow it was to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) vanity and pride.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as
reached your brother's ears, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own dressing-room
down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) steward in the
country.  So up he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for
Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on.
Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was used very
hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) into
a fainting fit.  Nancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) knees, and cried bitterly;
and your brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) walked about the room, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not know
what to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute
longer in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
knees too, to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to let them stay till they had packed up
their clothes.  THEN she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) fell into hysterics again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was so
frightened that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found
the house in all this uproar.  The carriage was at the door ready to
take my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) came
off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) says, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could hardly walk; and
Nancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was almost as bad.  I declare, I have no patience with your
sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).  Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hears of
it!  To have his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) love used so scornfully! for they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is monstrous
fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), as well he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) may.  I should not wonder, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was to be in
the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) and I
had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) is
gone back again to Harley Street, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) may be within call when Mrs.
Ferrars is told of it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was sent for as soon as ever my cousins
left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;
and so she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may, for what I care.  I have no pity for either of them.  I
have no notion of people's making such a to-do about money and
greatness.  There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should
not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knows better than
any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs.
Ferrars would only allow him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) five hundred a-year, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) would make as
good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.  Lord!
how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours--or a little
bigger--with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to
a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit
them exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collect
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was able to give such an answer, and make such
observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.
Happy to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not suspected of any extraordinary interest
in it; that Mrs. Jennings -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had of late often hoped might be the
case-RRB- had ceased to imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) at all attached to Edward; and happy
above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt very well able
to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) judgment,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one
concerned in it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could hardly determine what her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own expectation of its event really
was; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being
possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and
Lucy.  What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be a
doubt of its nature, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was anxious to hear; and still more anxious to
know how Edward would conduct himself.  For HIM she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) felt much
compassion;--for Lucy very little--and it cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) some pains to
procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.

<p/>As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the
necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion.  No time was to be
lost in undeceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), in making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) acquainted with the real truth,
and in endeavouring to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to hear it talked of by others,
without betraying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt any uneasiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, or any
resentment against Edward.

<p/>Elinor's office was a painful one.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was going to remove what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
really believed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's chief consolation,--to give such
particulars of Edward as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feared would ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for ever in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) good
opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,
which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own disappointment
over again.  But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to
be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was very far from wishing to dwell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own feelings, or to
represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the
self-command she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had practised since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first knowledge of Edward's
engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given
without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor
impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne
listened with horror, and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the
comforter of others in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own distresses, no less than in theirs; and
all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own composure
of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but
of imprudence, was readily offered.

<p/>But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.  Edward seemed
a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) HAD
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) most sincerely, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feel less than herself!  As for
Lucy Steele, she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) so totally unamiable, so absolutely
incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) could not be persuaded
at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of
Edward for her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) would not even admit it to have been natural; and
Elinor left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be convinced that it was so, by that which only
could convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), a better knowledge of mankind.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact
of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne's
feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of
detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
distress, lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) alarms, and combat her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) resentment.  The first
question on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) side, which led to farther particulars, was,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) written to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have known it these four months.  When Lucy first came to Barton
Park last November, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) told me in confidence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment which her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four months!--Have you known of this four months?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor confirmed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your
heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Four months!'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>--cried Marianne again.--<div class="bookquote">``So calm!--so cheerful!--how
have you been supported?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy, obliged me
to be secret.  I owed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), therefore, to avoid giving any hint of
the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in
them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to
satisfy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne seemed much struck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>added
Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``and once or twice I have attempted it;--but without betraying
my trust, I never could have convinced you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Four months!--and yet you loved him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But I did not love only him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>);--and while the comfort of others was
dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.
Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion.  I would not have
you suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer
materially myself.  I have many things to support me.  I am not
conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my
own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther.
I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.  I wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) very happy; and I
am so sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) always doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) duty, that though now he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) may harbour
some regret, in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,
and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And
after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a
single and constant attachment, and all that can be said of one's
happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not
meant--it is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward
will marry Lucy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) will marry a woman superior in person and
understanding to half her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sex; and time and habit will teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to
forget that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ever thought another superior to HER.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If such is your way of thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``if the loss of what
is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your
resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be
wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For
four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without
being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it
would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to
you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told
me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose
prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought,
with triumph.-- This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to
oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most
deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known
myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one
circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing
has proved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) unworthy; nor has anything declared him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) indifferent to
me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister, and
the insolence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother; and have suffered the punishment of an
attachment, without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been
going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only
unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you
may suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure of mind with which
I have brought myself at present to consider the matter, the
consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect of
constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of
themselves;--they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No,
Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing
could have kept me entirely--not even what I owed to my dearest
friends--from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy.'' (<font color='red'><b>-- Marianne</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Marianne was quite subdued.--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you have made me hate myself for ever.--How
barbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only comfort, who
have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only
suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can
make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying
to do it away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The tenderest caresses followed this confession.  In such a frame of
mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
whatever promise she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) required; and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) request, Marianne engaged
never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of
bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of
dislike to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>);--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring
them together, without any diminution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) usual cordiality.-- These
were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had injured,
no reparation could be too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to make.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) performed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) promise of being discreet, to admiration.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an
unchanging complexion, dissented from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) in nothing, and was heard
three times to say, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) praise of Lucy
with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings
talked of Edward's affection, it cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) only a spasm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
throat.--Such advances towards heroism in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister, made Elinor feel
equal to any thing herself.

<p/>The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their
brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful
affair, and bring them news of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have heard, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with great solemnity, as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was seated, <div class="bookquote">``of the very shocking discovery that took place under
our roof yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``has suffered dreadfully.  Mrs. Ferrars
too--in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but I
will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us
quite overcome.  Poor Fanny! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in hysterics all yesterday.  But I
would not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there is nothing materially
to be apprehended; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) constitution is a good one, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) resolution
equal to any thing.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has borne it all, with the fortitude of an
angel!  She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never shall think well of anybody again; and one
cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--meeting with such
ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shewn, so much confidence
had been placed!  It was quite out of the benevolence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had asked these young women to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) house; merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved
girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished
very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your
kind friend there, was attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) daughter.  And now to be so
rewarded!  'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
affectionate way, `that we had asked your sisters instead of them.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stopped to be thanked; which being done, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), is
not to be described.  While she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with the truest affection had been
planning a most eligible connection for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), was it to be supposed that
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such a
suspicion could never have entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head!  If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) suspected ANY
prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter.  `THERE, to
be sure,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), 'I might have thought myself safe.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was quite
in an agony.  We consulted together, however, as to what should be
done, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) determined to send for Edward.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) came.  But I
am sorry to relate what ensued.  All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well
suppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of no avail.
Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.  I never thought Edward
so stubborn, so unfeeling before.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
liberal designs, in case of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marrying Miss Morton; told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would settle on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax,
brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew
desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
still persisted in this low connection, represented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) the certain
penury that must attend the match.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own two thousand pounds she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
protested should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) all; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) again; and so far
would she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) be from affording him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) the smallest assistance, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
were to enter into any profession with a view of better support, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would do all in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) power to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) advancing in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hands
together, and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Gracious God!  can this be possible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well may you wonder, Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brother, <div class="bookquote">``at the obstinacy
which could resist such arguments as these.  Your exclamation is very
natural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne was going to retort, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) promises, and
forbore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All this, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``was urged in vain.  Edward said
very little; but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did say, was in the most determined manner.
Nothing should prevail on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) engagement.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would
stand to it, cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) what it might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be
silent, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.
Dashwood, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had done otherwise, I should have thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) a
rascal.  I have some little concern in the business, as well as
yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a
better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good
husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/>John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) nature was calm, not open
to provocation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) never wished to offend anybody, especially
anybody of good fortune.  He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) therefore replied, without any resentment,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,
madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,
but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.
And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>)
uncle's care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune
as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In
short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom
you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) extremely happy;
and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every
conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has
been dignified and liberal.  Edward has drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own lot, and I fear
it will be a bad one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne sighed out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) similar apprehension; and Elinor's heart wrung
for the feelings of Edward, while braving his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother's threats, for a
woman who could not reward him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, <div class="bookquote">``and how did it end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is
dismissed for ever from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother's notice.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house
yesterday, but where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is gone, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is still in town, I do
not know; for WE of course can make no inquiry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor young man!--and what is to become of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, indeed, ma'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.  Born to the
prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive a situation more
deplorable.  The interest of two thousand pounds--how can a man live on
it?--and when to that is added the recollection, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might, but for
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two
thousand, five hundred a-year -LRB-for Miss Morton has thirty thousand
pounds,-RRB- I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition.  We must
all feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and the more so, because it is totally out of our
power to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor young man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jennings, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be very
welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if I
could see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  It is not fit that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be living about at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
charge now, at lodgings and taverns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor's heart thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for such kindness towards Edward, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could not forbear smiling at the form of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would only have done as well by himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said John Dashwood,
<div class="bookquote">``as all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) friends were disposed to do by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might now have been
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing.  But as it
is, it must be out of anybody's power to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).  And there is one
thing more preparing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), which must be worse than all--his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle
THAT estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward's, on
proper conditions.  I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) this morning with her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lawyer, talking
over the business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, <div class="bookquote">``that is HER revenge.  Everybody has a way
of their own.  But I don't think mine would be, to make one son
independent, because another had plagued me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne got up and walked about the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>continued John,
<div class="bookquote">``than to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) younger brother in possession of an estate which might
have been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own?  Poor Edward!  I feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sincerely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
visit; and with repeated assurances to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sisters that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really
believed there was no material danger in Fanny's indisposition, and
that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) went away;
leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present
occasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the
Dashwoods', and Edward's.

<p/>Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quitted the room; and
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in
Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the
party.



<p/>CHAPTER 38


<p/>Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) praise of Edward's conduct, but only
Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit.  THEY only knew how
little he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had had to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be disobedient, and how small was the
consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in the loss of friends and fortune.  Elinor gloried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
integrity; and Marianne forgave all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) offences in compassion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
punishment.  But though confidence between them was, by this public
discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which
either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.  Elinor avoided it
upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts, by the
too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's
continued affection for herself which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) rather wished to do away; and
Marianne's courage soon failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), in trying to converse upon a topic
which always left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the
comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister had
hoped, to urge her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to exertion now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt it with all the pain of
continual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had never
exerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,
without the hope of amendment.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind was so much weakened that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
still fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only
dispirited her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) more.

<p/>Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs
in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings.  But though so much of the
matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had
enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after
more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and
inquiry to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) cousins as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could; and nothing but the
hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) going to them
within that time.

<p/>The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so
fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,
though it was only the second week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor
were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were
again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather
to stay at home, than venture into so public a place.

<p/>An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they
entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) continuing
with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was
herself left to quiet reflection.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) saw nothing of the Willoughbys,
nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by
any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>).  But at last
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,
though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting
them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of
Mrs. Jennings, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own party for a short time, to join their's.
Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get it all out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), my dear.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) will tell you any thing if you
ask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity and Elinor's too,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked; for nothing would
otherwise have been learnt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to meet you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Miss Steele, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) familiarly by
the arm--<div class="bookquote">``for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.''   (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Steele/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>And
then lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about
it.  Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) angry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, I believe, with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot suppose it possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have had such a time of
it!  I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) vowed at first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me
again, so long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lived; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is quite come to, and we are
as good friends as ever.  Look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) made me this bow to my hat, and put
in the feather last night.  There now, YOU are going to laugh at me
too.  But why should not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it IS
the Doctor's favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part, I should never
have known he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) DID like it better than any other colour, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had not
happened to say so.  My cousins have been so plaguing me!  I declare
sometimes I do not know which way to look before them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,
and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) way back again to
the first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but Miss Dashwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>speaking triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``people may say what
they chuse about Mr. Ferrars's declaring he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) would not have Lucy, for it
is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such
ill-natured reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might think
about it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set
it down for certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by more than
one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses could
expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty
thousand pounds to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at
all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.  And besides that, my cousin
Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was afraid Mr.
Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three
days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart
Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother's
Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not all Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday, and did not know what was become of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).  Once Lucy thought
to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), but then her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) spirits rose against that.  However this
morning he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came just as we came home from church; and then it all came
out, how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been
talked to by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother and all of them, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had declared before
them all that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
have.  And how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been so worried by what passed, that as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had went away from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother's house, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had got upon his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) horse,
and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had stayed
about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better
of it.  And after thinking it all over and over again, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, it
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as if, now he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it
would be quite unkind to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on to the engagement, because it must
be for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loss, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no
hope of any thing else; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was to go into orders, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had some
thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live
upon that?--He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not bear to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doing no better, and so
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) begged, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had the least mind for it, to put an end to the
matter directly, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) shift for himself.  I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) say all
this as plain as could possibly be.  And it was entirely for HER sake,
and upon HER account, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said a word about being off, and not upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own.  I will take my oath he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never dropt a syllable of being tired
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it.  But,
to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) directly -LRB-with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,
and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things you
know-RRB---she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) directly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had not the least mind in the world
to be off, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could live with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) upon a trifle, and how little so
ever he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might have, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should be very glad to have it all, you know,
or something of the kind.  So then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was monstrous happy, and talked
on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should take
orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) got a living.
And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called from
below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) coach, and would take
one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the room
and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would like to go, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did
not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of
silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor;
<div class="bookquote">``you were all in the same room together, were not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love
when any body else is by?  Oh, for shame!--To be sure you must know
better than that.  -LRB-Laughing affectedly.-RRB---No, no; they were shut up in
the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the
door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``have you been repeating to me what you only
learnt yourself by listening at the door?  I am sorry I did not know it
before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me
particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known
yourself.  How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stood at the door, and heard
what I could.  And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me;
for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets
together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind a
chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be
kept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is
lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.  What an ill-natured woman his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother is,
an't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I
shan't say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure they did send
us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for.  And
for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us
for the huswifes she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had gave us a day or two before; but, however,
nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight.
Edward have got some business at Oxford, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) says; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must go there
for a time; and after THAT, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) can light upon a Bishop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
will be ordained.  I wonder what curacy he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) will get!--Good gracious!
-LRB-giggling as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) spoke-RRB- I'd lay my life I know what my cousins will
say, when they hear of it.  They will tell me I should write to the
Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) new living.  I know they will;
but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.-- `La!' I
shall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think of such a thing?  I
write to the Doctor, indeed!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst.
You have got your answer ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) own party made another more necessary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.  I had a vast deal more to say to
you, but I must not stay away from them not any longer.  I assure you
they are very genteel people.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) makes a monstrous deal of money, and
they keep their own coach.  I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings
about it myself, but pray tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) I am quite happy to hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is not
in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything
should happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings
should want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) for as long a time as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) likes.  I suppose Lady Middleton
won't ask us any more this bout.  Good-by; I am sorry Miss Marianne was
not here.  Remember me kindly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  La! if you have not got your
spotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) parting concern; for after this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had time only to pay
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) company was
claimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of
knowledge which might feed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) powers of reflection some time, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and
foreplanned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own mind.  Edward's marriage with Lucy was as firmly
determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely
uncertain, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,
exactly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) expectation, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) getting that preferment, of
which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.

<p/>As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for
information; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible
intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own consequence, would
choose to have known.  The continuance of their engagement, and the
means that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following
natural remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) having a living!--ay, we all know how THAT will
end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,
will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.
Pratt can give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>).--Then they will have a child every year! and Lord
help 'em! how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give them
towards furnishing their house.  Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I
talked of t`other day.--No, no, they must get a stout girl of all
works.-- Betty's sister would never do for them NOW.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from
Lucy herself.  It was as follows:

<p/>``Bartlett's Building, March.

<p/>``I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the
liberty I take of writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); but I know your
friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such
a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after
all the troubles we have went through lately,
therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed
to say that, thank God! though we have suffered
dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy
as we must always be in one another's love.  We have
had great trials, and great persecutions, but
however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge
many friends, yourself not the least among them,
whose great kindness I shall always thankfully
remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of
it.  I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise
dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) yesterday afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would not hear of our
parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my
duty required, urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to it for prudence sake,
and would have parted for ever on the spot, would
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) consent to it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said it should never be,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did not regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother's anger, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could
have my affections; our prospects are not very
bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for
the best; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) will be ordained shortly; and should
it ever be in your power to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to any
body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you
will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too,
trust she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) will speak a good word for us to Sir John,
or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to
assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did it for the best, so I say
nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't think it too much
trouble to give us a call, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) come this way
any morning, `twould be a great kindness, and my
cousins would be proud to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>).--My paper reminds
me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully
and respectfully remembered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), and to Sir John,
and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you
chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am, &c.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as Elinor had finished it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) performed what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) concluded to
be its writer's real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.
Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and
praise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well indeed!--how prettily she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) writes!--aye, that was quite
proper to let him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) be off if he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) would.  That was just like Lucy.--Poor
soul! I wish I COULD get him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) a living, with all my heart.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) calls me
dear Mrs. Jennings, you see.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is a good-hearted girl as ever
lived.--Very well upon my word.  That sentence is very prettily turned.
Yes, yes, I will go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), sure enough.  How attentive she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is, to
think of every body!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.  It is as
pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy's head and heart great
credit.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 39


<p/>The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,
and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sighed
for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if
any place could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardly
less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent
on its being effected immediately, as that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was conscious of the
difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought
to acknowledge.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) began, however, seriously to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thoughts
towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to
their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from
home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more
eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about
the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with
them.  This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy
of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by
Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
manners towards them since her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister had been known to be unhappy,
induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to accept it with pleasure.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) told Marianne what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had done, however, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) first reply was
not very auspicious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cleveland!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) cried, with great agitation.  <div class="bookquote">``No, I cannot go to
Cleveland.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor gently, <div class="bookquote">``that its situation is not...that it
is not in the neighbourhood of...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go into Somersetshire.--There,
where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to
go there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such
feelings;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only endeavoured to counteract them by working on
others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the
time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) returning to that dear mother, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) so much wished to
see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan
could do, and perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland, which
was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not
beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servant
might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no
occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be
at home in little more than three weeks' time.  As Marianne's affection
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty,
over the imaginary evils she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had started.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) guests, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
pressed them very earnestly to return with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) again from Cleveland.
Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
design; and their mother's concurrence being readily gained, every
thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--and
Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that
were yet to divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from Barton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss
Dashwoods;'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>--was Mrs. Jennings's address to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) first called on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), after their leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was settled--<div class="bookquote">``for they are quite resolved
upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be, when I
come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two
cats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their
future ennui, to provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to make that offer, which might give
himself an escape from it;--and if so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had soon afterwards good
reason to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the
window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was going to copy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to it with a look of
particular meaning, and conversed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) there for several minutes.
The effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) discourse on the lady too, could not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
observation, for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was too honorable to listen, and had even
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) seat, on purpose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might NOT hear, to one close by
the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not keep
herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with
agitation, and was too intent on what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hopes, in the
interval of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another, some words
of the Colonel's inevitably reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ear, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) seemed to be
apologising for the badness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) house.  This set the matter beyond a
doubt.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wondered, indeed, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) thinking it necessary to do so;
but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.  What Elinor said in reply
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lips, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings
commended her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) heart for being so honest.  They then talked on
for a few minutes longer without her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) catching a syllable, when another
lucky stop in Marianne's performance brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) these words in the
Colonel's calm voice,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was almost
ready to cry out, <div class="bookquote">``Lord! what should hinder it?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--but checking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very strange!--sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) need not wait to be older.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend or
mortify his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the
conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings
very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to
feel what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) gratitude, and only wondered that
after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave
of them, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away
without making her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) any reply!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had not thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) old friend could
have made so indifferent a suitor.

<p/>What had really passed between them was to this effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), with great compassion, <div class="bookquote">``of the injustice your
friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) family; for if I understand
the matter right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) has been entirely cast off by them for persevering
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been
rightly informed?--Is it so?--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) that it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) replied, with great
feeling,--<div class="bookquote">``of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long
attached to each other, is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) may be doing--what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) may drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son to.  I have seen Mr.
Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted
in a short time, but I have seen enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) to wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) well for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.  I understand
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) intends to take orders.  Will you be so good as to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this
day's post, is his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) think it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) acceptance--but THAT,
perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) is now, it may be
nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more  valuable.-- It
is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did not
make more than 200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable of
improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) a very
comfortable income.  Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) to it, will be very great.  Pray assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been
greater, had the Colonel been really making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) an offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hand.
The preferment, which only two days before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had considered as
hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to marry;--and
SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different
cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might
have a share in that emotion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) esteem for the general benevolence,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) gratitude for the particular friendship, which together
prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly
expressed.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) for it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) heart, spoke of
Edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) knew
them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with
pleasure, if it were really his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wish to put off so agreeable an office
to another.  But at the same time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) could not help thinking that no
one could so well perform it as himself.  It was an office in short,
from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an
obligation from HER, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) would have been very glad to be spared
herself;-- but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining
it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
means, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) would not on any account make farther opposition.
Edward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) believed, was still in town, and fortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) address from Miss Steele.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) could undertake therefore to inform
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) of it, in the course of the day.  After this had been settled,
Colonel Brandon began to talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own advantage in securing so
respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent;--an
evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) to do, made very
light of, at least as far as regarded its size.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The smallness of the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I cannot imagine any
inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and
income.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr.
Ferrars's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation; for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such
an income, as anybody in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) style of life would venture to settle
on--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable
as a bachelor; it cannot enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) to marry.  I am sorry to say that
my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive.
If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) farther, I must think very differently of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) from what I now do,
if I am not as ready to be useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) then as I sincerely wish I
could be at present.  What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,
since it can advance him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) so little towards what must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) principal,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) only object of happiness.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) marriage must still be a distant
good;--at least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/>Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended the
delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of what
really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at
the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may
perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less
properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.



<p/>CHAPTER 40


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Dashwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soon
as the gentleman had withdrawn, <div class="bookquote">``I do not ask you what the Colonel has
been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of
hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) business.
And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I wish you
joy of it with all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor.  <div class="bookquote">``It is a matter of great joy to me;
and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly.  There are
not many men who would act as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has done.  Few people who have so
compassionate a heart!  I never was more astonished in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I an't the least astonished at it
in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more
likely to happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's general benevolence;
but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very
soon occur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Opportunity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Jennings--<div class="bookquote">``Oh! as to that, when a man has
once made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to such a thing, somehow or other he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will soon
find an opportunity.  Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and
again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I
shall soon know where to look for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, with a
faint smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  And as to the house being a bad one,
I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as
ever I saw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) spoke of its being out of repair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and whose fault is that? why don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) repair it?--who should do
it but himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><p/>They were interrupted by the servant's coming in to announce the
carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to
go, said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out.
But, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be
quite alone.  I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind
is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must
long to tell your sister all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mention
it at present to any body else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed.  <div class="bookquote">``Then you
would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as
Holborn to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please.  One day's delay will not be
very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought
not to be mentioned to any body else.  I shall do THAT directly.  It is
of importance that no time should be lost with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) will of
course have much to do relative to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) ordination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/>This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly.  Why Mr.
Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could
not immediately comprehend.  A few moments' reflection, however,
produced a very happy idea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) exclaimed;--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ho!--I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be the man.  Well, so
much the better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>).  Ay, to be sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) must be ordained in
readiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between
you.  But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?  Should not
the Colonel write himself?--sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) is the proper person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings's
speech, neither did she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) think it worth inquiring into; and therefore
only replied to its conclusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) rather wished any one to
announce his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so YOU are forced to do it.  Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy!
However, I will not disturb you -LRB-seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) preparing to write.-RRB-  You
know your own concerns best.  So goodby, my dear.  I have not heard of
any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And away she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went; but returning again in a moment,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just been thinking of Betty's sister, my dear.  I should be
very glad to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) so good a mistress.  But whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) would do for
a lady's maid, I am sure I can't tell.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) is an excellent housemaid,
and works very well at her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) needle.  However, you will think of all that
at your leisure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said,
and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.

<p/>How she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) should begin--how she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) should express herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) note to
Edward, was now all her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) concern.  The particular circumstances between
them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have
been the easiest thing in the world; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) equally feared to say too
much or too little, and sat deliberating over her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) paper, with the pen
in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) way to the carriage, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
came to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) farewell card; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), after apologising for not
returning herself, had obliged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to enter, by saying that Miss
Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) on very particular
business.

<p/>Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself
properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the
information by word of mouth, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) visitor entered, to force her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
upon this greatest exertion of all.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) astonishment and confusion
were very great on his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) so sudden appearance.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
before since his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) engagement became public, and therefore not since his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been thinking of, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.  He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) too was much
distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of
embarrassment.--Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pardon for his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) intrusion on
first coming into the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) could not recollect; but determining to
be on the safe side, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) apology in form as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) could
say any thing, after taking a chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Jennings told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that you wished to speak with me, at
least I understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) so--or I certainly should not have intruded on
you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been
extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;
especially as it will most likely be some time--it is not probable that
I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again.  I go to Oxford
tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not have gone, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, recovering herself,
and determined to get over what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) so much dreaded as soon as
possible, <div class="bookquote">``without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been
able to give them in person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
said.  I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on
the point of communicating by paper.  I am charged with a most
agreeable office -LRB-breathing rather faster than usual as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) spoke.-RRB-
Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to
say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has great pleasure
in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes
it were more valuable.  Allow me to congratulate you on having so
respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wish that the
living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much more considerable,
and such as might better enable you to--as might be more than a
temporary accommodation to yourself--such, in short, as might establish
all your views of happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>What Edward felt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could not say it himself, it cannot be expected
that any one else should say for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) LOOKED all the astonishment
which such unexpected, such unthought-of information could not fail of
exciting; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said only these two words,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Brandon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the
worst was over, <div class="bookquote">``Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) concern
for what has lately passed--for the cruel situation in which the
unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern which I
am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and
likewise as a proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) high esteem for your general character, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find
friendship any where.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), with sudden consciousness, <div class="bookquote">``not to find it in YOU;
for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it
all.--I feel it--I would express it if I could--but, as you well know,
I am no orator.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very much mistaken.  I do assure you that you owe it entirely,
at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's
discernment of it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,
till I understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) design, that the living was vacant; nor had it
ever occurred to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) might have had such a living in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) gift.
As a friend of mine, of my family, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) may, perhaps--indeed I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
HAS, still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe
nothing to my solicitation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Truth obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) to acknowledge some small share in the action, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of
Edward, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably
contributed to fix that suspicion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mind which had recently
entered it.  For a short time he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sat deep in thought, after Elinor had
ceased to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.  I have
always heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
highly.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) manners perfectly
the gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``I believe that you will find him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), on farther
acquaintance, all that you have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to be, and as you will be
such very near neighbours -LRB-for I understand the parsonage is almost
close to the mansion-house,-RRB- it is particularly important that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
SHOULD be all this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Edward made no answer; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) head, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the
mansion-house much greater.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), soon
afterwards, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) chair.

<p/>Elinor told him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) the number of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must hurry away then, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) those thanks which you will not
allow me to give YOU; to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) has made me a very--an
exceedingly happy man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor did not offer to detain him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>); and they parted, with a very
earnest assurance on HER side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) unceasing good wishes for his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
happiness in every change of situation that might befall him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>); on HIS (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>),
with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power of
expressing it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I see him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
out, <div class="bookquote">``I shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) the husband of Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And with this pleasing anticipation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sat down to reconsider the
past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of
Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own with discontent.

<p/>When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) returned from seeing people
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had never seen before, and of whom therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) must have a
great deal to say, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mind was so much more occupied by the important
secret in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) possession, than by anything else, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) reverted to
it again as soon as Elinor appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I sent you up the young man.  Did not I
do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty--You did not find
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very unwilling to accept your proposal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how soon will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``I know so little of these kind of forms, that I
can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation
necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ordination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two or three months!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jennings; <div class="bookquote">``Lord! my dear, how calmly
you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord
bless me!--I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though
one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think
it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>).  Sure
somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in
orders already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``what can you be thinking of?-- Why,
Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the
Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.
Ferrars!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation
immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for
the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs.
Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still
without forfeiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) expectation of the first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), after the first
ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, <div class="bookquote">``and very likely MAY
be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I thought, for a
house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor,
and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--and to
you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- It seems quite
ridiculous.  But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some
thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy
goes to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living's
being enough to allow them to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has two thousand a-year
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) thinks that nobody else can marry on less.  Take my word
for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford
Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan't go if Lucy an't
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was quite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion, as to the probability of their not
waiting for any thing more.



<p/>CHAPTER 41


<p/>Edward, having carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
reached Bartlett's Buildings, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was able to assure Mrs.
Jennings, who called on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) again the next day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
congratulations, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in such spirits before in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) life.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own happiness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own spirits, were at least very certain; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) expectation of their
being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.
So far was she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor
that credit which Edward WOULD give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to
own all their obligation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and openly declared that no exertion
for their good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or future, would
ever surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) capable of doing any thing in
the world for those she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) really valued.  As for Colonel Brandon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was
not only ready to worship him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) as a saint, but was moreover truly
anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;
anxious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) tithes should be raised to the utmost; and scarcely
resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) possibly could,
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) servants, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) carriage, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) cows, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) poultry.

<p/>It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley
Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
wife's indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel
it necessary to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a visit.--This was an obligation, however,
which not only opposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own inclination, but which had not the
assistance of any encouragement from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) companions.  Marianne, not
contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to
prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
carriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs.
John Dashwood, that not even her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) curiosity to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) looked after
the late discovery, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) strong desire to affront her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) by taking
Edward's part, could overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) unwillingness to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) company
again.  The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a
visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run
the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others had
so much reason to dislike.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the
house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband accidentally came out.  He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) expressed great pleasure
in meeting Elinor, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been just going to call in
Berkeley Street, and, assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that Fanny would be very glad to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to come in.

<p/>They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny is in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own room, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>):--<div class="bookquote">``I will go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
presently, for I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will not have the least objection in the
world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it, indeed.  NOW especially there
cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always great
favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Elinor made what excuse she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sorry to see you alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``for I have a good deal
to say to you.  This living of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--has
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was
coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of
Delaford to Edward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no
connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a
price!--what was the value of this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About two hundred a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--and for the next presentation to a living of that
value--supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and
likely to vacate it soon--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might have got I dare say--fourteen
hundred pounds.  And how came he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) not to have settled that matter before
this person's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a
man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) should be so improvident
in a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I am convinced
that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human
character.  I suppose, however--on recollection--that the case may
probably be THIS.  Edward is only to hold the living till the person to
whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to
take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel
Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which
it was given, obliged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) authority.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is truly astonishing!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cried, after hearing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
said--<div class="bookquote">``what could be the Colonel's motive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky
man.--You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I
have broke it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bears it vastly well,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will not like
to hear it much talked of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother, by which neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) child could be possibly
impoverished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Ferrars,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) voice to the tone becoming so
important a subject, <div class="bookquote">``knows nothing about it at present, and I believe
it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) as long as may
be.-- When the marriage takes place, I fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) must hear of it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be
supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in
knowing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be
quite out of the question; yet why, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) late behaviour, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
supposed to feel at all?--She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) has done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) cast him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) off
for ever, and has made all those over whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had any influence, cast
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) off likewise.  Surely, after doing so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) cannot be imagined
liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) account--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) cannot
be interested in any thing that befalls him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).-- She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) would not be so weak
as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of
a parent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said John, <div class="bookquote">``your reasoning is very good, but it is
founded on ignorance of human nature.  When Edward's unhappy match
takes place, depend upon it his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother will feel as much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
never discarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); and, therefore every circumstance that may
accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as much as
possible.  Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) memory
by THIS time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wrong her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) exceedingly.  Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most
affectionate mothers in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We think NOW,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood/Mr. Henry Dashwood</b></font>)</div>--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, <div class="bookquote">``of ROBERT'S
marrying Miss Morton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood/Mr. Henry Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother's
tone, calmly replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Choice!--how do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be
the same to Miss Morton whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) marry Edward or Robert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all
intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any
thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that
one is superior to the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.--His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
reflections ended thus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of ONE thing, my dear sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>kindly taking her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand, and speaking in
an awful whisper,--<div class="bookquote">``I may assure you;--and I WILL do it, because I know
it must gratify you.  I have good reason to think--indeed I have it
from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it
would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but I have it from the
very best authority--not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say
it herself--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) daughter DID, and I have it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)--That in
short, whatever objections there might be against a certain--a certain
connection--you understand me--it would have been far preferable to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), it would not have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) half the vexation that THIS does.  I
was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that
light--a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.  `It would
have been beyond comparison,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) said, `the least evil of the two, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse.' But however, all
that is quite out of the question--not to be thought of or
mentioned--as to any attachment you know--it never could be--all that
is gone by.  But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I
knew how much it must please you.  Not that you have any reason to
regret, my dear Elinor.  There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly
well--quite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered.  Has
Colonel Brandon been with you lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) vanity, and raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
self-importance, to agitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) nerves and fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind;--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply
herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.  After a few moments'
chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
sister's being there, quitted the room in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and Elinor was
left to improve her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay
unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) manner while enjoying so
unfair a division of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mother's love and liberality, to the prejudice
of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) banished brother, earned only by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own dissipated course of
life, and that brother's integrity, was confirming her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) most
unfavourable opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) head and heart.

<p/>They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) began to
speak of Edward; for he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), too, had heard of the living, and was very
inquisitive on the subject.  Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very
different, was not less striking than it had been on HIM.  He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) laughed
most immoderately.  The idea of Edward's being a clergyman, and living
in a small parsonage-house, diverted him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) beyond measure;--and when to
that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a
white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith
and Mary Brown, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could conceive nothing more ridiculous.

<p/>Elinor, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) waited in silence and immovable gravity, the
conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes from being fixed
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited.  It was a
look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own feelings,
and gave no intelligence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was recalled from wit to wisdom,
not by any reproof of hers, but by his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) own sensibility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We may treat it as a joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), at last, recovering from the
affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety
of the moment--<div class="bookquote">``but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business.  Poor
Edward!  he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is ruined for ever.  I am extremely sorry for it--for I
know him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellow
perhaps, as any in the world.  You must not judge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), Miss
Dashwood, from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) manners are
certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born, you
know, with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in a circle of strangers!--to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but
upon my soul, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has as good a heart as any in the kingdom;
and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as
when it all burst forth.  I could not believe it.-- My mother was the
first person who told me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act
with resolution, immediately said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), `My dear madam, I do not know
what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must
say, that if Edward does marry this young woman, I never will see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
again.' That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly
shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has done for himself
completely--shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but, as
I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least surprised at it;
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) style of education, it was always to be expected.  My poor
mother was half frantic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever seen the lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; once, while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was staying in this house, I happened to drop in
for ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).  The merest awkward
country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.--
I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) perfectly.  Just the kind of girl I should suppose
likely to captivate poor Edward.  I offered immediately, as soon as my
mother related the affair to me, to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) myself, and dissuade
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found, to do any thing,
for unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it
till after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you
know, to interfere.  But had I been informed of it a few hours
earlier--I think it is most probable--that something might have been
hit on.  I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very
strong light.  `My dear fellow,' I should have said, `consider what you
are doing.  You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a
one as your family are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot help
thinking, in short, that means might have been found.  But now it is
all too late.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must be starved, you know;--that is certain;
absolutely starved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance
of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject.  But though SHE never
spoke of it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own family, Elinor could see its influence on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) behaviour to herself.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister were so soon to leave town, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had hoped to see more of
them;--an exertion in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband, who attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) into the
room, and hung enamoured over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) accents, seemed to distinguish every
thing that was most affectionate and graceful.



<p/>CHAPTER 42


<p/>One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
brother's congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton
without any expense, and on Colonel Brandon's being to follow them to
Cleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother and
sisters in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to Norland
whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all things was
the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public,
assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should
come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting in the
country.

<p/>It amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to observe that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) friends seemed determined to send
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to Delaford;--a place, in which, of all others, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would now least
chuse to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it considered as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) future home by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy, when
they parted, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) a pressing invitation to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) there.

<p/>Very early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two parties
from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective
homes, to meet, by appointment, on the road.  For the convenience of
Charlotte and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) child, they were to be more than two days on their
journey, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel
Brandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.

<p/>Marianne, few as had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hours of comfort in London, and eager as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point, bid
adieu to the house in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had for the last time enjoyed those
hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now extinguished
for ever, without great pain.  Nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) leave the place in which
Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which
SHE could have no share, without shedding many tears.

<p/>Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had no such object for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lingering thoughts to fix on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) left
no creature behind, from whom it would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a moment's regret to be
divided for ever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was pleased to be free herself from the
persecution of Lucy's friendship, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was grateful for bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
sister away unseen by Willoughby since his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) marriage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked
forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might
do towards restoring Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own.

<p/>Their journey was safely performed.  The second day brought them into
the cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was
it dwelt on by turns in Marianne's imagination; and in the forenoon of
the third they drove up to Cleveland.

<p/>Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping
lawn.  It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably
extensive; and like every other place of the same degree of importance,
it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smooth
gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn was
dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship of
the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of them
altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars, shut out the
offices.

<p/>Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the
consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty
from Combe Magna; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been five minutes within its
walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) child
to the housekeeper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) quitted it again, stealing away through the
winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a
distant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eye, wandering
over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on
the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their
summits Combe Magna might be seen.

<p/>In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) rejoiced in tears
of agony to be at Cleveland; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) returned by a different circuit
to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, of
wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) remained
with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house,
on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the rest of
the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen
garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the
gardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the
green-house, where the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) favourite plants, unwarily exposed,
and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of
Charlotte,--and in visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) poultry-yard, where, in the
disappointed hopes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or
being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising young
brood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) found fresh sources of merriment.

<p/>The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) plan of employment
abroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay
at Cleveland.  With great surprise therefore, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) find herself
prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all over
the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from it; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry
or pleasant weather for walking.

<p/>Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away.  Mrs. Palmer
had her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) child, and Mrs. Jennings her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) carpet-work; they talked of the
friends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton's engagements,
and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther
than Reading that night.  Elinor, however little concerned in it,
joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by
the family in general, soon procured herself a book.

<p/>Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that constant and friendly
good humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome.  The
openness and heartiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) manner more than atoned for that want of
recollection and elegance which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) often deficient in the forms
of politeness; her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) kindness, recommended by so pretty a face, was
engaging; her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it was
not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) laugh.

<p/>The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner, affording
a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome variety to
their conversation, which a long morning of the same continued rain had
reduced very low.

<p/>Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen so
much variety in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) address to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister and herself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew
not what to expect to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own family.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>),
however, perfectly the gentleman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) behaviour to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) visitors,
and only occasionally rude to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from
being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much
superior to people in general, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) must feel himself to be to Mrs.
Jennings and Charlotte.  For the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) character and habits, they
were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all
unusual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) sex and time of life.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was nice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) eating,
uncertain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) hours; fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) child, though affecting to slight
it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been
devoted to business.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), however, upon the whole, much
better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had expected, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart was not sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could like him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) no more;--not sorry to be driven by the observation of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) Epicurism, his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) selfishness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) conceit, to rest with
complacency on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple
taste, and diffident feelings.

<p/>Of Edward, or at least of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) concerns, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now received
intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire
lately; and who, treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) at once as the disinterested friend of
Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself, talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) a
great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies,
and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) meant to do himself towards removing them.--His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) in this, as well as in every other particular, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
open pleasure in meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) after an absence of only ten days, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
readiness to converse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) deference for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) opinion,
might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) attachment,
and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the
first, believed Marianne his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) real favourite, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) suspect it
herself.  But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
head, except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not help
believing herself the nicest observer of the two;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) behaviour;--and while his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head and
throat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,
entirely escaped the latter lady's observation;--SHE could discover in
them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.

<p/>Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all
over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,
where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the
trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,
had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wet
shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a
day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing
ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.
Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all
declined.  Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) limbs, and a
cough, and a sore throat, a good night's rest was to cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) entirely;
and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) went
to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.



<p/>CHAPTER 43


<p/>Marianne got up the next morning at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) usual time; to every inquiry
replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was better, and tried to prove herself so, by engaging
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) accustomary employments.  But a day spent in sitting shivering
over the fire with a book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was unable to read, or
in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) amendment; and when, at last, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went early to bed, more and more
indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) sister's
composure, who, though attending and nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) the whole day, against
Marianne's inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) at night,
trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, and
felt no real alarm.

<p/>A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the
expectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,
confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice, of sending
for the Palmers' apothecary.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmers</b></font>) came, examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmers</b></font>) patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to
expect that a very few days would restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister to health, yet, by
pronouncing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the
word <div class="bookquote">``infection''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>to pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmers</b></font>) lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) baby's account.  Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the
first to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor, now
looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming Charlotte's
fears and caution, urged the necessity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) immediate removal with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as
idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wife too great to be
withstood.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour
after Mr. Harris's arrival, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) set off, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little boy and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a
few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband promised, at
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) earnest entreaty, to join her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in a day or two; and whither she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
almost equally urgent with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).  Mrs. Jennings,
however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as
Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own attentive care,
to supply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) the place of the mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from; and
Elinor found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,
desirous to share in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fatigues, and often by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) better
experience in nursing, of material use.

<p/>Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) malady, and
feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow
would find her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have
produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for
on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended
the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their
mother by surprise on the following forenoon.  The little she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) said was
all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to
raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believe, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) THEN really believed
herself, that it would be a very short one.

<p/>The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the
patient; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) certainly was not better, and, except that there was no
amendment, did not appear worse.  Their party was now farther reduced;
for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity
and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
promise of following her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>); and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was preparing to go, Colonel
Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going
likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most
acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) love was in so much
uneasiness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister's account, would be to deprive them both, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) at once that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) should want him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to
play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
sister, &c. she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) so strongly to remain, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), who was
gratifying the first wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own heart by a compliance, could not
long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's entreaty was
warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,
in leaving behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) a person so well able to assist or advise Miss
Dashwood in any emergence.

<p/>Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been the means of sending the owners of
Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival.  It
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) no surprise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) likewise no concern, she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) never mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) name.

<p/>Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
situation continued, with little variation, the same.  Mr. Harris, who
attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and
Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others
was by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined very early
in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel
Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's
forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of
the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the
admission of every melancholy idea, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could not expel from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
mind the persuasion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) should see Marianne no more.

<p/>On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of
both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) declared
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) patient materially better.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) pulse was much stronger, and every
symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed
in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own judgment rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them
at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able
to travel.

<p/>But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.-- Towards the
evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and
uncomfortable than before.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, however, still sanguine, was
willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of
having sat up to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bed made; and carefully administering the
cordials prescribed, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), with satisfaction, sink at last into a
slumber, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expected the most beneficial effects.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a
considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
resolved to sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings,
knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to
bed; her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating
herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with
Marianne.

<p/>The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) continual change of
posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint
which passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lips, was almost wishing to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from so painful
a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in
the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is mama coming?--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried the other, concealing her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) terror, and assisting
Marianne to lie down again, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) will be here, I hope, before it is
long.  It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) must not go round by London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, in the same
hurried manner.  <div class="bookquote">``I shall never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) goes by London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor perceived with alarm that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not quite herself, and, while
attempting to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), eagerly felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pulse.  It was lower and
quicker than ever!  and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) on sending instantly
for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother.
To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the
latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its
performance; and as soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had rung up the maid to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) place by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) hastened down to the drawing-room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.

<p/>It was no time for hesitation.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) fears and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) difficulties were
immediately before him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) fears, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had no courage, no confidence to
attempt the removal of:--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) listened to them in silent despondence;--but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that
seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) mind,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.
Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) went to hurry off his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horses
directly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wrote a few lines to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/>The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or such
a companion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a companion
whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve, and whose
friendship might soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)!--as far as the shock of such a summons
COULD be lessened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) presence, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) manners, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) assistance,
would lessen it.

<p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), meanwhile, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) might feel, acted with all the firmness of a
collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost
despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) might
look for his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.  The
horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon
only pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken
too low to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) ear, hurried into the carriage.  It was then about
twelve o'clock, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) sister's apartment to wait for
the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) the rest of the
night.  It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.  Hour after
hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and
in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) former
security; and the servant who sat up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would not allow
Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) more, by hints of what
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mistress had always thought.

<p/>Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
mother, and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) name, it gave a pang to the
heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with
so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,
fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had
been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) suffering mother
arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) rational.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) could
not come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after
five o'clock--arrived.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) opinion, however, made some little amends
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and
unpleasant alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) patient, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) would not allow the danger to
be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment
must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was
communicated to Elinor.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) promised to call again in the course of
three or four hours, and left both the patient and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) anxious
attendant more composed than he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) had found them.

<p/>With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to
their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) no
doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's danger would not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to offer the
comfort of hope.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart was really grieved.  The rapid decay, the
early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck
a less interested person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings's compassion
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had other claims.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had been for three months her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) companion, was
still under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) care, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was known to have been greatly injured,
and long unhappy.  The distress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister too, particularly a
favourite, was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>);--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings
considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to
herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere.

<p/>Mr. Harris was punctual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) second visit;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) came to be
disappointed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) hopes of what the last would produce.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>)
medicines had failed;--the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more
quiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching
all, and more than all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) fears in a moment, proposed to call in
further advice.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) judged it unnecessary: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) had still something
more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) was as
confident as the last, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) visit concluded with encouraging
assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss
Dashwood.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was calm, except when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
was almost hopeless; and in this state she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) continued till noon,
scarcely stirring from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister's bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thoughts wandering from
one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) spirits
oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who
scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the
many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointment
had brought on.  Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it
gave fresh misery to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reflections.

<p/>About noon, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) began--but with a caution--a dread of
disappointment which for some time kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) silent, even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend--to fancy, to hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could perceive a slight amendment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister's pulse;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) waited, watched, and examined it again and
again;--and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under
exterior calmness, than all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) foregoing distress, ventured to
communicate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,
to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) young friend from
indulging a thought of its continuance;--and Elinor, conning over every
injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was
too late.  Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious
flutter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister to watch--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hardly knew for what.
Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).
Others even arose to confirm it.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) breath, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) skin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lips, all
flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and hope now
oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in equal degrees, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) no moment of tranquillity
till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;--when his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) assurances,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) felicitations on a recovery in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister even surpassing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>)
expectation, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.

<p/>Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the
partial justification of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) forebodings which had been found in their
late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) judgment, and admitted,
with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the
probability of an entire recovery.

<p/>Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) joy was of a different kind, and led
to any thing rather than to gaiety.  Marianne restored to life, health,
friends, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) doting mother, was an idea to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart with
sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent
gratitude;--but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,
no smiles.  All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and
strong.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) continued by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, with little intermission the
whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every
look and every breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,
in some moments, occur to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) of what anxiety was--but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
saw, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of
recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet,
steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) silenced every
doubt.

<p/>The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected
back.  At ten o'clock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) trusted, or at least not much later her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) must
now be travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely
less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress of time which
yet kept them in ignorance!

<p/>At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) joined
Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.  Of breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been
kept by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating
much;--and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of
content as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brought to it, was particularly welcome.  Mrs. Jennings
would have persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), at its conclusion, to take some rest before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) place by Marianne; but
Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that moment
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not to be kept away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister an
unnecessary instant.  Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) up stairs
into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) there again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) charge and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thoughts, and retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
own room to write letters and sleep.

<p/>The night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared round the house, and
the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,
regarded it not.  Marianne slept through every blast; and the
travellers--they had a rich reward in store, for every present
inconvenience.

<p/>The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten, Elinor would have been
convinced that at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heard a carriage driving up to the
house; and so strong was the persuasion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) DID, in spite of the
ALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) moved into
the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be
satisfied of the truth.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantly saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ears had not
deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).  The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in
view.  By their uncertain light she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could discern it to be
drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) poor
mother's alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.

<p/>Never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at
that moment.  The knowledge of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother must be feeling as the
carriage stopt at the door--of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) doubt--her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dread--perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
despair!--and of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was
impossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done was to be speedy;
and, therefore staying only till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) hurried down stairs.

<p/>The bustle in the vestibule, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) passed along an inner lobby,
assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) that they were already in the house.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) rushed to the
drawing-room,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.



<p/>CHAPTER 44


<p/>Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), obeyed
the first impulse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart in turning instantly to quit the room,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than
supplication,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--I entreat you to
stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) replied with firmness, <div class="bookquote">``I shall NOT stay.  Your business
cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell you that
Mr. Palmer was not in the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had they told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) cried with vehemence, <div class="bookquote">``that Mr. Palmer and all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the
door.  My business is with you, and only you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With me!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--in the utmost amazement--<div class="bookquote">``well, sir,--be quick--and if you
can--less violent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, and I will be both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hesitated; she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew not what to do.  The possibility of Colonel
Brandon's arriving and finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) there, came across her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>).  But she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had
promised to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) curiosity no less than her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) honor was
engaged.  After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that
prudence required dispatch, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) acquiescence would best
promote it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) walked silently towards the table, and sat down.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by
either.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray be quick, sir,'' (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>--said Elinor, impatiently;--<div class="bookquote">``I have no time to
spare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to
hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), with abruptness, a moment afterwards--<div class="bookquote">``is out
of danger.  I heard it from the servant.  God be praised!--But is it
true? is it really true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor would not speak.  He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated the inquiry with yet greater
eagerness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For God's sake tell me, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) out of danger, or is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rose up, and walked across the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had I known as much half an hour ago--But since I AM here,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--speaking
with a forced vivacity as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seat--<div class="bookquote">``what does it
signify?--For once, Miss Dashwood--it will be the last time,
perhaps--let us be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for
gaiety.-- Tell me honestly'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--a deeper glow overspreading his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
cheeks--<div class="bookquote">``do you think me most a knave or a fool?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with greater astonishment than ever.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) began to
think that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a visit, and
of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this
impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediately rose, saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe--I am not
at leisure to remain with you longer.-- Whatever your business may be
with me, will it be better recollected and explained to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Combe</b></font>) replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice
perfectly calm; <div class="bookquote">``yes, I am very drunk.-- A pint of porter with my cold
beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Marlborough!'' (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>--cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand
what he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) would be at.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock, and the only ten
minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a
nuncheon at Marlborough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The steadiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) manner, and the intelligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)
spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) to Cleveland, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was not brought there by intoxication, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
said, after a moment's recollection,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly DO--that after what
has passed--your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself upon
my notice, requires a very particular excuse.--What is it, that you
mean by it?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), with serious energy--<div class="bookquote">``if I can, to make you hate me
one degree less than you do NOW.  I mean to offer some kind of
explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart
to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a
blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like
forgiveness from Ma--from your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this the real reason of your coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul it is,'' (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>--was his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) answer, with a warmth which brought all
the former Willoughby to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) remembrance, and in spite of herself made
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) think him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) sincere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--for Marianne DOES--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
has LONG forgiven you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) cried, in the same eager tone.-- <div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has forgiven
me before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ought to have done it.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) shall forgive me again,
and on more reasonable grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) assent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), after a pause of expectation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) side, and
thoughtfulness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own,--<div class="bookquote">``how YOU may have accounted for my
behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have
imputed to me.-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is
worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.  When I first
became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view
in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged
to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.
Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not but
please me; and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a
kind--It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE
was, that my heart should have been so insensible!  But at first I must
confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.  Careless of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) happiness,
thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had
always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every
means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), without any design
of returning her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with the most
angry contempt, stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), by saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me
to listen any longer.  Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by
any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the
subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I insist on you hearing the whole of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``My fortune was
never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of
associating with people of better income than myself.  Every year since
my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and
though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet
that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for
some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a
woman of fortune.  To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not
a thing to be thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness,
cruelty--which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss
Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting in this manner,
trying to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) regard, without a thought of returning it.--But
one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish
vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I
did not THEN know what it was to love.  But have I ever known it?--Well
may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my
feelings to vanity, to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have
sacrificed hers?-- But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,
which her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) affection and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) society would have deprived of all its
horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that
could make it a blessing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, a little softened, <div class="bookquote">``believe yourself at
one time attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such
tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have done it?--Yes, I
found myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); and the
happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) when I felt my
intentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.  Even
THEN, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), I
allowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment
of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my
circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.  I will not reason here--nor
will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than
absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already
bound.  The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with
great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself
contemptible and wretched for ever.  At last, however, my resolution
was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) alone,
to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>), and openly
assure her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) of an affection which I had already taken such pains to
display.  But in the interim--in the interim of the very few hours that
were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)
in private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin
all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery took
place,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--here he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) hesitated and looked down.--<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Smith had somehow or
other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest
it was to deprive me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) favour, of an affair, a connection--but I
need not explain myself farther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) added, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) with an
heightened colour and an enquiring eye--<div class="bookquote">``your particular intimacy--you
have probably heard the whole story long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart
anew against any compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have heard it all.  And how you
will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I
confess is beyond my comprehension.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>cried Willoughby, <div class="bookquote">``from whom you received the account.
Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) situation and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
character ought to have been respected by me.  I do not mean to justify
myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have
nothing to urge--that because she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was injured she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was irreproachable,
and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.  If the violence of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) passions, the weakness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) understanding--I do not mean,
however, to defend myself.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) affection for me deserved better
treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness
which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.  I
wish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured more than
herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me---LRB-may I say
it?-RRB- was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind--Oh! how
infinitely superior!'' (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl--I must say
it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well
be--your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).  Do
not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of
understanding on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.
You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in
Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
reduced to the extremest indigence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) warmly replied; <div class="bookquote">``I did not
recollect that I had omitted to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) my direction; and common sense
might have told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) how to find it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be
guessed.  The purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) life, the formality of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) notions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
ignorance of the world--every thing was against me.  The matter itself
I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was
previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in
general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,
the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), in my
present visit.  In short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I
might have saved myself.  In the height of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) morality, good woman!
she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza.  That could
not be--and I was formally dismissed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) favour and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) house.
The night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--was
spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be.  The
struggle was great--but it ended too soon.  My affection for Marianne,
my thorough conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) attachment to me--it was all insufficient
to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false
ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to
feel, and expensive society had increased.  I had reason to believe
myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and I
persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained
for me to do.  A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave
Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; some
apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement.  But
whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a
point of long debate.  To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and
I even doubted whether I could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) again, and keep to my
resolution.  In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,
as the event declared; for I went, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) miserable,
and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) miserable--and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hoping never to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, reproachfully; <div class="bookquote">``a note
would have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was necessary to my own pride.  I could not bear to leave the
country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the
neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between
Mrs. Smith and myself--and I resolved therefore on calling at the
cottage, in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister, however,
was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) alone.
You were all gone I do not know where.  I had left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) only the evening
before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right!  A
few hours were to have engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to me for ever; and I remember how
happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to
Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body!  But in
this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with a sense
of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
sorrow, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) disappointment, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) deep regret, when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that I was
obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I never shall forget
it--united too with such reliance, such confidence in me!--Oh,
God!--what a hard-hearted rascal I was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both silent for a few moments.  Elinor first spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that you should soon return?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) replied, impatiently; <div class="bookquote">``less than
was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more
than was justified by the future.  I cannot think of it.--It won't
do.--Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
kindness and confidence.  Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I was
miserable.  Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it
gives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge to myself
for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past
sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now.  Well, I
went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was
only indifferent.  My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,
and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my own reflections
so cheerful--when I looked forward every thing so inviting!--when I
looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed
journey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, who, though pitying him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>), grew impatient for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) departure, <div class="bookquote">``and this is all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?-- That infamous
letter--Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) shew it you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I saw every note that passed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When the first of hers reached me -LRB-as it immediately did, for I was in
town the whole time,-RRB- what I felt is--in the common phrase, not to be
expressed; in a more simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any
emotion--my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word
was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) here,
would forbid--a dagger to my heart.  To know that Marianne was in town
was--in the same language--a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and
daggers!--what a reproof would she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) have given me!--her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) taste, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
opinions--I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am
sure they are dearer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this
extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt it
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) duty to check such ideas in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) companion as the last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are married.
Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marianne's note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) as in
former days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been
separated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was as constant in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own feelings, and as full of
faith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say
awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in
some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened
villain, fancying myself indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and chusing to fancy that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of our
past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my
shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,
overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, 'I shall be
heartily glad to hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is well married.'-- But this note made me
know myself better.  I felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was infinitely dearer to me than
any other woman in the world, and that I was using her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) infamously.  But
every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me.  To retreat
was impossible.  All that I had to do, was to avoid you both.  I sent
no answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
farther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call in
Berkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of a
cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safely
out of the house one morning, and left my name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Watched us out of the house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even so.  You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how
often I was on the point of falling in with you.  I have entered many a
shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I did
in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a
glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant
watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep
out of your sight, could have separated us so long.  I avoided the
Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was
likely to prove an acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being in
town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings's.  He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) asked me
to a party, a dance at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) house in the evening.--Had he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) NOT told me as
an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have
felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).  The next
morning brought another short note from Marianne--still affectionate,
open, artless, confiding--everything that could make MY conduct most
hateful.  I could not answer it.  I tried--but could not frame a
sentence.  But I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), I believe, every moment of the day.
If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was THEN.
With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the
happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse
than all.  Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on
me; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!--
Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in
such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand to me, asking me for an
explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking
solicitude on my face!--and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other
hand, looking all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is over
now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;
but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white as
death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);--the last
manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) appeared to me.  It was a horrid sight!--yet when I
thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me
to imagine that I knew exactly how she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would appear to those, who saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) last in this world.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was before me, constantly before me, as I
travelled, in the same look and hue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.  Willoughby first
rousing himself, broke it thus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let me make haste and be gone.  Your sister is certainly better,
certainly out of danger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are assured of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing to
say about that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, THAT in particular.  Your sister wrote to me again, you
know, the very next morning.  You saw what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said.  I was
breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) letter, with some others, was
brought to me there from my lodgings.  It happened to catch Sophia's
eye before it caught mine--and its size, the elegance of the paper, the
hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) a suspicion.  Some vague
report had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) before of my attachment to some young lady in
Devonshire, and what had passed within her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) observation the preceding
evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) more jealous
than ever.  Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is
delightful in a woman one loves, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opened the letter directly,
and read its contents.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was well paid for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) impudence.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) read what made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wretched.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wretchedness I could have
borne, but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passion--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) malice--At all events it must be appeased.
And, in short--what do you think of my wife's style of
letter-writing?--delicate--tender--truly feminine--was it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as
I was ashamed to put my name to.  The original was all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own
happy thoughts and gentle diction.  But what could I do!--we were
engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am
talking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) money
was necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be
done to prevent a rupture.  And after all, what did it signify to my
character in the opinion of Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) friends, in what language
my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.  My business
was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a
bluster was of little importance.-- 'I am ruined for ever in their
opinion--' said I to myself--'I am shut out for ever from their
society, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter will
only make them think me a blackguard one.' Such were my reasonings, as,
in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wife's words, and
parted with the last relics of Marianne.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) three notes--unluckily
they were all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their
existence, and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up, and
could not even kiss them.  And the lock of hair--that too I had always
carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now searched by
Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock--all, every
memento was torn from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, while
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) compassionate emotion;
<div class="bookquote">``you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my
sister.  You had made your own choice.  It was not forced on you.  Your
wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least.  She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
must be attached to you, or she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not have married you.  To treat
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with unkindness, to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slightingly is no atonement to
Marianne--nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not talk to me of my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) with a heavy sigh.-- <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does
not deserve your compassion.--She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew I had no regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) when we
married.--Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be
happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity
me, Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?-- Am I--be
it only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion than I was
before?--My intentions were not always wrong.  Have I explained away
any part of my guilt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little.-- You have proved
yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you.  You have
proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked.  But I hardly
know--the misery that you have inflicted--I hardly know what could have
made it worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you repeat to your sister when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is recovered, what I have been
telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) opinion as well
as in yours.  You tell me that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has forgiven me already.  Let me be
able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present
feelings, will draw from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a more spontaneous, more natural, more
gentle, less dignified, forgiveness.  Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of my misery and my
penitence--tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that my heart was never inconstant to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and if
you will, that at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is dearer to me than ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) all that is necessary to what may comparatively be
called, your justification.  But you have not explained to me the
particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) illness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) saw who I was--for the first time these two months--he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) spoke to
me.--That he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without
surprise or resentment.  Now, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) good-natured, honest, stupid
soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister,
could not resist the temptation of telling me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) knew ought
to--though probably he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) did not think it WOULD--vex me horridly.  As
bluntly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) could speak it, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) told me that Marianne
Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter that
morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) danger most
imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &c.--I was too much
shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the
undiscerning Sir John.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) heart was softened in seeing mine suffer;
and so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
almost shook me by the hand while he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) reminded me of an old promise
about a pointer puppy.  What I felt on hearing that your sister was
dying--and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth,
scorning, hating me in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) latest moments--for how could I tell what
horrid projects might not have been imputed?  ONE person I was sure
would represent me as capable of any thing-- What I felt was
dreadful!--My resolution was soon made, and at eight o'clock this
morning I was in my carriage.  Now you know all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor made no answer.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts were silently fixed on the
irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent
habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the
character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person
and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a
feeling, affectionate temper.  The world had made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) extravagant and
vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cold-hearted and selfish.
Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another,
had involved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least
its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.  Each faulty
propensity in leading him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to evil, had led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likewise to punishment.
The attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, against
every better interest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had outwardly torn himself, now, when no
longer allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for the
sake of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, with little scruple, left her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister to misery,
was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more
incurable nature.  From a reverie of this kind she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was recalled at the
end of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie
at least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no use in staying here; I must be off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going back to town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--to Combe Magna.  I have business there; from thence to town in a
day or two.  Good bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) hand.  She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not refuse to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) hers;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>)
pressed it with affection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you DO think something better of me than you did?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--said he (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>),
letting it fall, and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting
he (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) was to go.

<p/>Elinor assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did;--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) forgave, pitied, wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>)
well--was even interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) happiness--and added some gentle
counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) answer was
not very encouraging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I must rub through the world as well as I can.
Domestic happiness is out of the question.  If, however, I am allowed
to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it
may be the means--it may put me on my guard--at least, it may be
something to live for.  Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.
Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) with a reproof.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) replied--<div class="bookquote">``once more good bye. I shall now go away and live
in dread of one event.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister's marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very wrong.  She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) can never be more lost to you than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will be gained by some one else.  And if that some one should
be the very he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) whom, of all others, I could least bear--but I will not
stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing that
where I have most injured I can least forgive.  Good bye,--God bless
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And with these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) almost ran out of the room.



<p/>CHAPTER 45


<p/>Elinor, for some time after he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for some time even after the
sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a
crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness
was the general result, to think even of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Willoughby, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), whom only half an hour ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had abhorred as the most
worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) faults, excited a
degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) as now separated for ever from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) family, with a
tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) soon acknowledged
within herself--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) wishes than to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) merits.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not
in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that
open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess;
and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even
innocent to indulge.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt that it was so, long, long before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) influence less.

<p/>When at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) returned to the unconscious Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hopes.  Elinor's heart was full.  The past, the present, the
future, Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother's
expected arrival, threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) altogether into an agitation of spirits
which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) only fearful
of betraying herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister.  Short was the time, however, in
which that fear could affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), for within half an hour after
Willoughby's leaving the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was again called down stairs by the
sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother from every
unnecessary moment's horrible suspense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ran immediately into the
hall, and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) entered it.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced
almost the conviction of Marianne's being no more, had no voice to
inquire after her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither
for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother, catching it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) usual warmth, was in a moment as much
overcome by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) happiness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been before by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fears.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was supported into the drawing-room between her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend;--and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to
speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) at intervals
to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at once her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
gratitude, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) sharing with herself in the bliss
of the moment.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shared it, however, in a silence even greater than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own.

<p/>As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
first desire; and in two minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) beloved child,
rendered dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.
Elinor's delight, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw what each felt in the meeting, was only
checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther
sleep;--but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when
the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and conscious of being too weak for
conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by
every nurse around her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).  Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) all night;
and Elinor, in compliance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's entreaty, went to bed.  But
the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the
most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by
irritation of spirits.  Willoughby, <div class="bookquote">``poor Willoughby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now
allowed herself to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), was constantly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would
not but have heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) vindication for the world, and now blamed, now
acquitted herself for having judged him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) so harshly before.  But her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
promise of relating it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister was invariably painful.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne
might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could ever be
happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.
Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
sufferings and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) constancy far more than to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) rival's, the reward
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.
Willoughby's death.

<p/>The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been much softened
to Mrs. Dashwood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own previous alarm; for so great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
uneasiness about Marianne, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had already determined to set out
for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further
intelligence, and had so far settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) journey before his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) arrival,
that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away,
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mother was unwilling to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) where there might be infection.

<p/>Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness of
Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to be, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) repeatedly
declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world.  Elinor could
not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes
wondering whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother ever recollected Edward.  But Mrs.
Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own disappointment
which Elinor had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), was led away by the exuberance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) joy to
think only of what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
from a danger in which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) now began to feel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own mistaken
judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had
contributed to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);--and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) recovery she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had yet another
source of joy unthought of by Elinor.  It was thus imparted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), as
soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last we are alone.  My Elinor, you do not yet know all my
happiness.  Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has told me so himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter feeling</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and
not surprised, was all silent attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your
composure now.  Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my
family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you as
the object most desirable.  And I believe Marianne will be the most
happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) of the two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was half inclined to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reason for thinking so, because
satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age,
characters, or feelings, could be given;--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother must always be
carried away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) imagination on any interesting subject, and
therefore instead of an inquiry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) passed it off with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled.  It came
out quite unawares, quite undesignedly.  I, you may well believe, could
talk of nothing but my child;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) distress; I saw
that it equalled my own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) perhaps, thinking that mere friendship,
as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,
not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible feelings,
made me acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) earnest, tender, constant, affection for
Marianne.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), my Elinor, ever since the first moment of
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language, not the professions
of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's
active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as it chose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby

knowledge of dear Marianne's unhappy prepossession for that worthless
young man!--and without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) happy with another--Such a noble mind!--such openness,

has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);
and even my own knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though lately acquired, is very
considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that if Marianne
can be happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I shall be as ready as yourself to think our
connection the greatest blessing to us in the world.  What answer did
you give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?--Did you allow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to hope?''

Marianne might at that moment be dying.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not ask for hope or

effusion to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.  Yet
after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite overcome--that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
lived, as I trusted she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) might, my greatest happiness would lie in
promoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful
security, I have repeated it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more fully, have given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) every
encouragement in my power.  Time, a very little time, I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), will
do everything;--Marianne's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a
man as Willoughby.-- His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own merits must soon secure it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however, you have not yet made

difference of age and disposition he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could ever attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).  There,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) is quite mistaken.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) age is only so much beyond hers as
to be an advantage, as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) character and principles fixed;--and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make
your sister happy.  And his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) person, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) manners too, are all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
favour.  My partiality does not blind me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) certainly is not so
handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time, there is something much
more pleasing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) countenance.-- There was always a something,--if
you remember,--in Willoughby's eyes at times, which I did not like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, without waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)

attention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is much
more accordant with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) real disposition, than the liveliness--often
artificial, and often ill-timed of the other.  I am very sure myself,
that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has proved

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At Delaford, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) will be within an easy distance of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>added Mrs.

Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.



<p/>CHAPTER 46


<p/>Marianne's illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long
enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother's presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
to remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs.
Palmer's dressing-room.  When there, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own particular request, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was impatient to pour forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) thanks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) for fetching her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) emotion on entering the room, in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) altered looks, and in
receiving the pale hand which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) immediately held out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), was
such, as, in Elinor's conjecture, must arise from something more than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to
others; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) soon discovered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) melancholy eye and varying
complexion as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, the probable recurrence of many
past scenes of misery to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) mind, brought back by that resemblance
between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened
by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,
and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter, but
with a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to very
different effect, saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what arose
from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the actions
and words of Marianne she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) persuaded herself to think that something
more than gratitude already dawned.

<p/>At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger
every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
daughter's wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER
measures depended those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not
quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel Brandon was soon
brought, by their united request, to consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own abode there as
equally determinate, if not equally indispensable.  At his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) and Mrs.
Jennings's united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to
accept the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) carriage on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) journey back, for the better
accommodation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint
invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-nature
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself,
engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the
course of a few weeks.

<p/>The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking
so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly
grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own
heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding
Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully
assisted by him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) into the carriage, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) seemed anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
should engross at least half.  Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed,
and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and
feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) chaise
to take comfort in the gossip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) maid for the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) two young
companions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
solitary way to Delaford.

<p/>The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) journey
on both, without essential fatigue.  Every thing that the most zealous
affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) comfortable,
was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bodily ease, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) calmness of spirits.  To Elinor, the
observation of the latter was particularly grateful.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), who had seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of
heart which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to
conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an
apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) trusted
of serious reflection, must eventually lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to contentment and
cheerfulness.

<p/>As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every
field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) face from their
notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here, Elinor
could neither wonder nor blame; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) assisted
Marianne from the carriage, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been crying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw only an
emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,
and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
subsequent manner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) traced the direction of a mind awakened to
reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common
sitting-room, than Marianne turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes around it with a look of
resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the
sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be
connected.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,
and though a sigh sometimes escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), it never passed away without
the atonement of a smile.  After dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would try her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) piano-forte.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went to it; but the music on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eye first rested was an
opera, procured for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) by Willoughby, containing some of their
favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own name in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
hand-writing.--That would not do.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head, put the music
aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of
feebleness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring
however with firmness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did so, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) should in future practice
much.

<p/>The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms.  On the
contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) looked
and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of
Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which would
then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the
only happiness worth a wish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we will take long walks together every day.  We will walk to the
farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will
walk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;
and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its
foundations as far as we are told they once reached.  I know we shall
be happy.  I know the summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to
be later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall
divide every moment between music and reading.  I have formed my plan,
and am determined to enter on a course of serious study.  Our own
library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyond
mere amusement.  But there are many works well worth reading at the
Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can
borrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six hours a-day, I shall
gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which
I now feel myself to want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor honoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for a plan which originated so nobly as this;
though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work
in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and
virtuous self-control. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) smile however changed to a sigh when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of
Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy
tranquillity.  Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) resolved
to wait till her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's health were more secure, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) appointed
it.  But the resolution was made only to be broken.

<p/>Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was
fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out.  But at last a
soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter's
wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's
arm, was authorised to walk as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could without fatigue, in
the lane before the house.

<p/>The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an
exercise hitherto untried since her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) illness required;--and they had
advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the
hill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes turned
towards it, Marianne calmly said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, exactly there,'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>--pointing with one hand, <div class="bookquote">``on that projecting
mound,--there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the
spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--hesitatingly it
was said.--<div class="bookquote">``Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of it now, I hope, as I
ought to do.'' (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Elinor tenderly invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for regret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``I have done with that, as far as HE (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is
concerned.  I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), but what they are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on
one point, if I could be allowed to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was not ALWAYS acting
a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all, if I could be assured
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), since the story of that unfortunate girl'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) words as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) answered,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--for not only is it
horrible to suspect a person, who has been what HE (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has been to ME, of
such designs,--but what must it make me appear to myself?--What in a
situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could
expose me to'' (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How then,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``would you account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) behaviour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>),--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), only fickle,
very, very fickle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor said no more.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was debating within herself on the
eligibility of beginning her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) story directly, or postponing it till
Marianne were in stronger health;--and they crept on for a few minutes
in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) too much good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne at last with a
sigh, <div class="bookquote">``when I wish his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) secret reflections may be no more unpleasant
than my own.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) will suffer enough in them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you compare your conduct with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with
yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our situations have borne little resemblance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not, my dearest Elinor, let
your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure.  My
illness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for
serious recollection.  Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I
was perfectly able to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my own
behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) last
autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of
kindness to others.  I saw that my own feelings had prepared my
sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me
to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by
myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the
time to be wrong.  Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I
did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such
feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonder
that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for
atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I
died,--in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my
friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my
latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should
I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have
consoled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.  Whenever
I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing
indulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.  The kindness, the
unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful
contempt.  To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every
common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart
hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very
attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them, little as they
deserve, I had given less than their due.  But you,--you above all,
above my mother, had been wronged by me.  I, and only I, knew your
heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any
compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before
me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort?
Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking
any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular
gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge
alone?--No;--not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had
believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or
friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting
only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for
whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here ceased the rapid flow of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,
impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantly
that praise and support which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) frankness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) contrition so well
deserved.  Marianne pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand and replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good.--The future must be my proof.  I have laid down my
plan, and if I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall be
governed and my temper improved.  They shall no longer worry others,
nor torture myself.  I shall now live solely for my family.  You, my
mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will
share my affections entirely between you.  From you, from my home, I
shall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix
in other society, it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled, my
heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser
duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.  As for Willoughby--to
say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), would be idle.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or
opinions.  But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion,
by reason, by constant employment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) paused--and added in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``If I could but know HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) heart,
everything would become easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or
impropriety of speedily hazarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) narration, without feeling at all
nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as
reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself
leading to the fact.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) managed the recital, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hoped, with address; prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
anxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief
points on which Willoughby grounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) apology; did justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
repentance, and softened only his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) protestations of present regard.
Marianne said not a word.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) trembled, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes were fixed on the
ground, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lips became whiter than even sickness had left them.  A
thousand inquiries sprung up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dared not urge
one.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand,
unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's, and tears covered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/>Elinor, dreading her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) being tired, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) towards home; and till they
reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) curiosity
must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing
but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully
minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could
be safely indulged.  As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a
kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
tears, <div class="bookquote">``Tell mama,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>withdrew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister and walked slowly up
stairs.  Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable
as what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its
result, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne
fail to do it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) turned into the parlour to fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) parting
injunction.



<p/>CHAPTER 47


<p/>Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) former
favourite.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) rejoiced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) being cleared from some part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
imputed guilt;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) happy.  But the
feelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne.  Nothing
could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
means, nor remove the guilt of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) conduct towards Eliza.  Nothing
could replace him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), therefore, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) former esteem, nor injure the
interests of Colonel Brandon.

<p/>Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter, heard Willoughby's story from
himself--had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) witnessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) distress, and been under the influence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) countenance and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) manner, it is probable that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) compassion
would have been greater.  But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) retailed
explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself.  Reflection
had given calmness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) judgment, and sobered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own opinion of
Willoughby's deserts;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished, therefore, to declare only the
simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy
astray.

<p/>In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began
voluntarily to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) again;--but that it was not without an
effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been for
some time previously sitting--her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) rising colour, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spoke,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
unsteady voice, plainly shewed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to assure you both,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I see every thing--as you
can desire me to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) instantly with soothing
tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's
unbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) silence.  Marianne
slowly continued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told me this morning--I have
now heard exactly what I wished to hear.'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>--For some moments her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) voice
was lost; but recovering herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) added, and with greater calmness
than before--<div class="bookquote">``I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change.  I
never could have been happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), after knowing, as sooner or later
I must have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence, no
esteem.  Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it--I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.  <div class="bookquote">``Happy with a man of
libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest
of our friends, and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart
to be made happy with such a man!--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) conscience, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sensitive
conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) husband
ought to have felt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne sighed, and repeated, <div class="bookquote">``I wish for no change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You consider the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``exactly as a good mind and a
sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as
well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,
reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you
in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have
been poorly supported by an affection, on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) side, much less certain.
Had you married, you must have been always poor.  His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) expensiveness is
acknowledged even by himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) whole conduct declares that
self-denial is a word hardly understood by him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).  His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) demands and your
inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought
on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having
been entirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense of honour
and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation,
to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and,
perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,
you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--and how
little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin
which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT, had you
endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) enjoyments, is it not
to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to
consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heart,
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) regret the connection which had involved him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in such
difficulties?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne's lips quivered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) repeated the word <div class="bookquote">``Selfish?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in a
tone that implied--<div class="bookquote">``do you really think him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) selfish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) behaviour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``from the beginning to
the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness.  It was
selfishness which first made him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sport with your affections; which
afterwards, when his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own were engaged, made him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) delay the confession of
it, and which finally carried him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) from Barton.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) own enjoyment, or
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) own ease, was, in every particular, his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) ruling principle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very true.  MY happiness never was his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) regrets what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) has done.  And why
does he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) regret it?--Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) finds it has not answered towards
himself.  It has not made him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) happy.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) circumstances are now
unembarrassed--he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) suffers from no evil of that kind; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) thinks only
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself.
But does it follow that had he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) married you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would have been
happy?--The inconveniences would have been different.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would then
have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are
removed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) now reckons as nothing.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would have had a wife of whose
temper he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) could make no complaint, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would have been always
necessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank
the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far
more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a
wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not a doubt of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne; <div class="bookquote">``and I have nothing to
regret--nothing but my own folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood;
<div class="bookquote">``SHE must be answerable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each
felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might
weaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's spirits; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), therefore, pursuing the first
subject, immediately continued,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the
story--that all Willoughby's difficulties have arisen from the first
offence against virtue, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) behaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crime
has been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) present
discontents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was led
by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon's injuries and merits, warm
as friendship and design could unitedly dictate.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) daughter did not
look, however, as if much of it were heard by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expectation, saw on the two or three following
days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had done;
but while her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) resolution was unsubdued, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) still tried to appear
cheerful and easy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister could safely trust to the effect of time
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) health.

<p/>Margaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each
other, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their
usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to
Barton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.

<p/>Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had heard
nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) leaving London, nothing new of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) plans,
nothing certain even of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) present abode.  Some letters had passed
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness; and
in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:-- <div class="bookquote">``We know
nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so
prohibited a subject, but conclude him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be still at Oxford;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>which
was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) by the correspondence,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.
She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) measures.

<p/>Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and
when, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited at table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had satisfied the inquiries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mistress as to the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) errand, this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voluntary
communication--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes upon Elinor, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
turning pale, and fell back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) chair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood,
whose eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively
taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's
countenance how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really suffered, and a moment afterwards,
alike distressed by Marianne's situation, knew not on which child to
bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) principal attention.

<p/>The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense
enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance,
supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) into the other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather
better, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to the care of Margaret and the
maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far
recovered the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reason and voice as to be just beginning an
inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwood
immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the
benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, this morning in Exeter, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) lady
too, Miss Steele as was.  They was stopping in a chaise at the door of
the New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the
Park to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look up
as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss
Steele; so I took off my hat, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) knew me and called to me, and
inquired after you, ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss
Marianne, and bid me I should give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) compliments and Mr. Ferrars's,
their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not
time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go
forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but
howsever, when they come back, they'd make sure to come and see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But did she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was married, Thomas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) smiled, and said how she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) name since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was in these parts.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was always a very affable and free-spoken
young lady, and very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) joy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, I just see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) leaning back in it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) did not look
up;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) never was a gentleman much for talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor's heart could easily account for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) not putting himself
forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was there no one else in the carriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am, only they two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know where they came from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--Mrs. Ferrars told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are they going farther westward?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am--but not to bide long.  They will soon be back again, and
then they'd be sure and call here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter; but Elinor knew better than
to expect them.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and
was very confident that Edward would never come near them.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
observed in a low voice, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, that they were probably going
down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.

<p/>Thomas's intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished to
hear more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see them off, before you came away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am--the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any
longer; I was afraid of being late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) said how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was very well; and to my mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was
always a very handsome young lady--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) seemed vastly contented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the
tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.
Marianne had already sent to say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) should eat nothing more.
Mrs. Dashwood's and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret
might think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as both
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had often
had to be careless of their meals, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had never been obliged to go
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dinner before.

<p/>When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and
Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a
similarity of thoughtfulness and silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared to
hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) now
found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had erred in relying on Elinor's representation of
herself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly
softened at the time, to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) from an increase of unhappiness,
suffering as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) then had suffered for Marianne.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
daughter, to think the attachment, which once she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had so well
understood, much slighter in reality, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been wont to
believe, or than it was now proved to be.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feared that under this
persuasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
Elinor;--that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged, more
immediately before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), had too much engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tenderness, and led
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) away to forget that in Elinor she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might have a daughter suffering
almost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and greater
fortitude.



<p/>CHAPTER 48


<p/>Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an
unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,
and certainty itself.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now found, that in spite of herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had
always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something
would occur to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of
establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was now married; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) condemned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart for the lurking
flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.

<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should be married soon, before -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) imagined-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could be in
orders, and consequently before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could be in possession of the
living, surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a little at first.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) soon saw how likely
it was that Lucy, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) self-provident care, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) haste to secure
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), should overlook every thing but the risk of delay.  They were
married, married in town, and now hastening down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) uncle's.  What
had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
mother's servant, on hearing Lucy's message!

<p/>They would soon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) supposed, be settled at Delaford.--Delaford,--that
place in which so much conspired to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) an interest; which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
wished to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw them
in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active,
contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with
the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
economical practices;--pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own interest in every thought,
courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every
wealthy friend.  In Edward--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) knew not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) saw, nor what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) turned away
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) head from every sketch of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London
would write to them to announce the event, and give farther
particulars,--but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no
tidings.  Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found fault
with every absent friend.  They were all thoughtless or indolent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was an inquiry which
sprung from the impatience of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) mind to have something going on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to
hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) again.  I earnestly pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) coming to us, and should
not be surprised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was gaining something, something to look forward to.  Colonel
Brandon must have some information to give.

<p/>Scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) so determined it, when the figure of a man on
horseback drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) eyes to the window.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopt at their gate.  It was
a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself.  Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) could hear more;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) trembled in expectation of it.  But--it was NOT Colonel
Brandon--neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) air--nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) height.  Were it possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) must
say it must be Edward.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) looked again.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had just dismounted;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
could not be mistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) moved away and sat down.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us.  I WILL be calm; I WILL
be mistress of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) perceived that the others were likewise aware of the
mistake.  She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look
at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other.  She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would have
given the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>);--but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their
own discretion.

<p/>Not a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited in silence for the
appearance of their visitor.  His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) footsteps were heard along the gravel
path; in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was in the passage, and in another he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was before
them.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) countenance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) entered the room, was not too happy, even for
Elinor.  His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) complexion was white with agitation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) looked as if
fearful of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) reception, and conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) merited no kind one.
Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) trusted, to the wishes of
that daughter, by whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) then meant in the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) heart to be
guided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hand, and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) joy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.  Elinor's lips
had moved with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's, and, when the moment of action was over,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had shaken hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) too.  But it was then too
late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sat down again and
talked of the weather.

<p/>Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole of
the case, thought it incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to be dignified, and therefore
took a seat as far from him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could, and maintained a strict
silence.

<p/>When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very
awful pause took place.  It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who
felt obliged to hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In a
hurried manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) replied in the affirmative.

<p/>Another pause.

<p/>Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own
voice, now said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Longstaple!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) replied, with an air of surprise.-- <div class="bookquote">``No, my mother
is in town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, <div class="bookquote">``to inquire
for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dared not look up;--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother and Marianne both turned their
eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,
after some hesitation, said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs. ROBERT Ferrars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Robert Ferrars!'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>--was repeated by Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother in an
accent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak,
even HER eyes were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with the same impatient wonder.  He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not
knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and
while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to
pieces as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spoke, said, in a hurried voice,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard that my brother is
lately married to--to the youngest--to Miss Lucy Steele.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor,
who sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) head leaning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) work, in a state of such
agitation as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hardly know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could sit it no longer.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) almost ran out of the room, and as
soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought would never cease.  Edward, who had till then looked any
where, rather than at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hurry away, and perhaps saw--or even
heard, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) emotion; for immediately afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fell into a reverie,
which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs.
Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted
the room, and walked out towards the village--leaving the others in the
greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) situation, so
wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity which they had no means of
lessening but by their own conjectures.



<p/>CHAPTER 49


<p/>Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) release might
appear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and to
what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined
by all;--for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent
engagement, contracted without his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother's consent, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had already
done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in
the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction of another.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.  It was only to ask
Elinor to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>);--and considering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was not altogether
inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should
feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really did, so much in
need of encouragement and fresh air.

<p/>How soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how
soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
expressed himself, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was received, need not be particularly
told.  This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at
four o'clock, about three hours after his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had secured his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
lady, engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturous
profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one
of the happiest of men.  His (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) situation indeed was more than commonly
joyful.  He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to
swell his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) heart, and raise his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) spirits.  He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was released without any
reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
misery, from a woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had long ceased to love;--and elevated at
once to that security with another, which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) must have thought of
almost with despair, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had learnt to consider it with
desire.  He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to
happiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine,
flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) friends had never witnessed in
him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) before.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors
confessed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the
philosophic dignity of twenty-four.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the
consequence of ignorance of the world--and want of employment.  Had my
mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen
from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure, it would never
have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the
time, a most unconquerable preference for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) niece, yet had I then had
any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance
from her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied
attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I
must have done.  But instead of having any thing to do, instead of
having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any
myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first
twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which
belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered
at Oxford till I was nineteen.  I had therefore nothing in the world to
do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home
in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my
brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to
be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and
was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part
of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything
that was amiable and obliging.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was pretty too--at least I thought
so THEN; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no
comparisons, and see no defects.  Considering everything, therefore, I
hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every
way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable
piece of folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness
of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all, the
satisfaction of a sleepless night.  Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be
comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how
to be enough thankful for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) release without wounding his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) delicacy,
nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation
together, and yet enjoy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished, the sight and society of both.

<p/>Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.  Comparisons would
occur--regrets would arise;--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) joy, though sincere as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) love
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, was of a kind to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) neither spirits nor language.

<p/>But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of
learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the
moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
was every thing by turns but tranquil.  But when the second moment had
passed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) honourably
released from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) former engagement, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) instantly profiting by the
release, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, as
constant as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had ever supposed it to be,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was oppressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
overcome by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own felicity;--and happily disposed as is the human
mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it
required several hours to give sedateness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) spirits, or any degree
of tranquillity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever
other claims might be made on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), it was impossible that less than a
week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or
suffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and
the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of
incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in
common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is
different.  Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication is
even made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.

<p/>Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,
formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and
Elinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in
every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable
circumstances she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had ever heard.  How they could be thrown together,
and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of
whose beauty she (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had herself heard him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) speak without any admiration,--a
girl too already engaged to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) brother, and on whose account that
brother had been thrown off by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) family--it was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
comprehension to make out.  To her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own heart it was a delightful
affair, to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
reason, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) judgment, it was completely a puzzle.

<p/>Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,
at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked
on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.
Elinor remembered what Robert had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in Harley Street, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
opinion of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own mediation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brother's affairs might have
done, if applied to in time.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) repeated it to Edward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THAT was exactly like Robert,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) immediate observation.--<div class="bookquote">``And
THAT,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) presently added, <div class="bookquote">``might perhaps be in HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head when the
acquaintance between them first began.  And Lucy perhaps at first might
think only of procuring his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) good offices in my favour.  Other designs
might afterward arise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was equally
at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had
remained for choice ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quitting London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had had no means
of hearing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) but from herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) letters to the very last
were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.  Not the
smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for
what followed;--and when at last it burst on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in a letter from Lucy
herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been for some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) believed, half stupified between
the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) put the
letter into Elinor's hands.

<p/>``DEAR SIR,

<p/>``Being very sure I have long lost your affections,
I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own
on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as I once used to think I might be with you;
but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was
another's.  Sincerely wish you happy in your choice,
and it shall not be my fault if we are not always
good friends, as our near relationship now makes
proper.  I can safely say I owe you no ill-will,
and am sure you will be too generous to do us any
ill offices.  Your brother has gained my affections
entirely, and as we could not live without one
another, we are just returned from the altar, and
are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which
place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,
but thought I would first trouble you with these
few lines, and shall always remain,

<p/>``Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,
``LUCY FERRARS.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have burnt all your letters, and will return
your picture the first opportunity.  Please to destroy
my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very
welcome to keep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor read and returned it without any comment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div>said
Edward.--<div class="bookquote">``For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU
in former days.--In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!--how I

that since the first half year of our foolish--business--this is the
only letter I ever received from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), of which the substance made me
any amends for the defect of the style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``However it may have come about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, after a pause,--<div class="bookquote">``they
are certainly married.  And your mother has brought on herself a most
appropriate punishment.  The independence she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) settled on Robert,
through resentment against you, has put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) power to make his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own
choice; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has actually been bribing one son with a thousand
a-year, to do the very deed which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) disinherited the other for
intending to do.  She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert's
marrying Lucy, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have been by your marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) favourite.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)
will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
much sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div><p/>In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew
not, for no communication with any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) family had yet been attempted
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after
Lucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), the nearest
road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with
which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) could do
nothing till he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) were assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) fate with Miss Dashwood; and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>)
rapidity in seeking THAT fate, it is to be supposed, in spite of the
jealousy with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of
the modesty with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) rated his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) own deserts, and the politeness
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) doubts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) did not, upon the whole, expect
a very cruel reception.  It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) business, however, to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>)
DID, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) said it very prettily.  What he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) might say on the subject a
twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination of husbands and
wives.

<p/>That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of
malice against him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to
Elinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
character, had no scruple in believing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) capable of the utmost
meanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes had been long opened,
even before his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) acquaintance with Elinor began, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ignorance and a
want of liberality in some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinions--they had been equally
imputed, by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) want of education; and till her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) last letter
reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had always believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be a well-disposed,
good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.  Nothing but
such a persuasion could have prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) putting an end to an
engagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) open to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mother's anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it my duty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``independent of my feelings, to give
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was
renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in
the world to assist me.  In such a situation as that, where there
seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living
creature, how could I suppose, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so earnestly, so warmly
insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but
the most disinterested affection was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) inducement?  And even now, I
cannot comprehend on what motive she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) acted, or what fancied advantage
it could be to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), to be fettered to a man for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not the
smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) might suppose that something would occur in your favour;
that your own family might in time relent.  And at any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) lost
nothing by continuing the engagement, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) has proved that it
fettered neither her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) inclination nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) actions.  The connection was
certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) consideration
among her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would
be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) to marry YOU than be single.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div><p/>Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have
been more natural than Lucy's conduct, nor more self-evident than the
motive of it.

<p/>Elinor scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which
compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at
Norland, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must have felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own inconstancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``because--to say
nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to
fancy and expect WHAT, as you were THEN situated, could never be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could only plead an ignorance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own heart, and a mistaken
confidence in the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) engagement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted to
another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the
consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred
as my honour.  I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only
friendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and
Lucy, I did not know how far I was got.  After that, I suppose, I WAS
wrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I
reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than
these:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor smiled, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) head.

<p/>Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's being expected at the
Cottage, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really wished not only to be better acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>),
but to have an opportunity of convincing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) no longer resented
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) the living of Delaford--<div class="bookquote">``Which, at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must think I have never forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for offering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>NOW he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) felt astonished himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had never yet been to the place.
But so little interest had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) taken in the matter, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) owed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the parish,
condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself, who
had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it with so much
attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.

<p/>One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one
difficulty only was to be overcome.  They were brought together by
mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;
their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness
certain--and they only wanted something to live upon.  Edward had two
thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all
that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.
Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite
enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year
would supply them with the comforts of life.

<p/>Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mother towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); and on THAT he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) rested for the residue of their
income.  But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would
still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chusing herself had been
spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language as only a lesser evil
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chusing Lucy Steele, she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) feared that Robert's offence would
serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.

<p/>About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to
complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction, and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) the dignity of
having, for the first time since her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) living at Barton, more company
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) than her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the
privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every
night to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) old quarters at the Park; from whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) usually returned
in the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a-tete
before breakfast.

<p/>A three weeks' residence at Delaford, where, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) evening hours at
least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between
thirty-six and seventeen, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to Barton in a temper of mind
which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks, all the kindness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) welcome, and all the encouragement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother's language, to
make it cheerful.  Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>)
did revive.  No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>):--he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) knew
nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) visit were
consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.  Every thing was
explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) by Mrs. Dashwood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) found fresh reason to rejoice
in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the
interest of Elinor.

<p/>It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good
opinion of each other, as they advanced in each other's acquaintance,
for it could not be otherwise.  Their resemblance in good principles
and good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably
have been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other
attraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters
fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,
which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.

<p/>The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every
nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read
with less emotion than mirth.  Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the
wonderful tale, to vent her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) honest indignation against the jilting
girl, and pour forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
was sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all
accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.-- <div class="bookquote">``I do think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days
before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul
suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!  came
crying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars,
as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems
borrowed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) money before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) went off to be married, on purpose we
suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in
the world;--so I was very glad to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) five guineas to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)
down to Exeter, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) thinks of staying three or four weeks with
Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Burgess</b></font>), to fall in with the Doctor
again.  And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them along
with them in the chaise is worse than all.  Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot
get him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) out of my head, but you must send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to Barton, and Miss
Marianne must try to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn.  Mrs. Ferrars was the most
unfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of
sensibility--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) considered the existence of each, under such a
blow, with grateful wonder.  Robert's offence was unpardonable, but
Lucy's was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were ever again to be
mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) might hereafter be induced
to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife should never be acknowledged as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) presence.  The secrecy with
which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally
treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion
of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to
prevent the marriage; and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) called on Elinor to join with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in
regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward had not rather been
fulfilled, than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should thus be the means of spreading misery
farther in the family.-- He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) thus continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward's name, which does not
surprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been
received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) on the occasion.  Perhaps, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is kept silent
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) a hint, by a
line to Oxford, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister and I both think a letter of proper
submission from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shewn to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of
Mrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) wishes for nothing so much as to be
on good terms with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of
Edward.  It determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to attempt a reconciliation, though not
exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A letter of proper submission!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>repeated he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``would they have me beg
my mother's pardon for Robert's ingratitude to HER, and breach of
honour to ME?--I can make no submission--I am grown neither humble nor
penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy; but that would not
interest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may certainly ask to be forgiven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``because you have
offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to
profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew
on you your mother's anger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be
convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent
in HER eyes as the first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a
letter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by
word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing
to Fanny, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should go to London, and personally intreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good
offices in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) favour.-- <div class="bookquote">``And if they really DO interest themselves,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Marianne Dashwood/Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) new character of candour, <div class="bookquote">``in bringing about a
reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely
without merit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div><p/>After a visit on Colonel Brandon's side of only three or four days, the
two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to
Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) future
home, and assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) patron and friend in deciding on what improvements
were needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a couple of
nights, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was to proceed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) journey to town.



<p/>CHAPTER 50


<p/>After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent
and so steady as to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) from that reproach which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) always
seemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward
was admitted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) presence, and pronounced to be again her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.  For many years of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward
a few weeks ago, had robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) of one; the similar annihilation of
Robert had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) for a fortnight without any; and now, by the
resuscitation of Edward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had one again.

<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) being allowed once more to live, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did not
feel the continuance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) existence secure, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
feared, might give a sudden turn to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) constitution, and carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) off
as rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution therefore it was
revealed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was listened to with unexpected calmness.  Mrs.
Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) from marrying
Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) power;--told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), that in Miss
Morton he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--and
enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter
of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only
the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
representation, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--and
therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) owed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own
dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
issued her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.

<p/>What she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to
be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only son, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was by no means her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eldest; for while Robert was
inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest
objection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two
hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for
the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had
been given with Fanny.

<p/>It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by
Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) shuffling excuses,
seemed the only person surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) not giving more.

<p/>With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,
they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the
living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with
an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making
considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their
completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments
and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,
as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying
till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton
church early in the autumn.

<p/>The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the
Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the
Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--could
chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.  Mrs. Jennings's
prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was able to visit Edward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wife in their Parsonage by
Michaelmas, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) found in Elinor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really
believed, one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had in fact
nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,
and rather better pasturage for their cows.

<p/>They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations
and friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was
almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the
expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said John, as
they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford
House, <div class="bookquote">``THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one
of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is.  But, I
confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon
brother.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) property here, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) place, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) house, every thing is in
such respectable and excellent condition!--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) woods!--I have not
seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in
Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly
the person to attract him (<font color='blue'><b>Hanger</b></font>)--yet I think it would altogether be advisable
for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel
Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may
happen--for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of
anybody else--and it will always be in your power to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) off to
advantage, and so forth;--in short, you may as well give her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) a
chance--You understand me.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them
with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) real favour and preference.  THAT was due to the folly of Robert,
and the cunning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) wife; and it was earned by them before many
months had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had
at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) deliverance from it; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) respectful humility, assiduous
attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was
given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) choice, and
re-established him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) completely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) favour.

<p/>The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which
crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance
of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however
its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every
advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and
conscience.  When Robert first sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) acquaintance, and privately
visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) brother.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) merely meant to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to give up the
engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection
of both, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle
the matter.  In that point, however, and that only, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) erred;--for
though Lucy soon gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) hopes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) eloquence would convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to
produce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind when
they parted, which could only be removed by another half hour's
discourse with himself.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) attendance was by this means secured, and
the rest followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward, they came
gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had always
more to say than on any other, and in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) soon betrayed an
interest even equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own; and in short, it became speedily
evident to both, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had entirely supplanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brother.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was
proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of
marrying privately without his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother's consent.  What immediately
followed is known.  They passed some months in great happiness at
Dawlish; for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thence
returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the
simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was
adopted.  The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,
comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother no duty and
therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks
longer unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct and
messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for
the unkindness she (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was treated with, procured her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in time the haughty
notice which overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,
by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.
Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny;
and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended
to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), and Elinor, though superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in fortune and birth,
was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and
always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.  They settled in
town, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the
best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the
jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,
in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent
domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing
could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.

<p/>What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have
puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to
it, might have puzzled them still more.  It was an arrangement,
however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing
ever appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a
suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regretting the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) income, as either leaving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward
might be judged from the ready discharge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) duties in every
particular, from an increasing attachment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) home, and
from the regular cheerfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spirits, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might be supposed no
less contented with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lot, no less free from every wish of an
exchange.

<p/>Elinor's marriage divided her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as little from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) family as could well
be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).  Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure
in the frequency of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) visits at Delaford; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wish of bringing
Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though
rather more liberal than what John had expressed.  It was now her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
darling object.  Precious as was the company of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) daughter to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was
equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.  They each felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sorrows, and
their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the
reward of all.

<p/>With such a confederacy against her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)--with a knowledge so intimate of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) goodness--with a conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fond attachment to herself,
which at last, though long after it was observable to everybody
else--burst on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)--what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) do?

<p/>Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was born to
discover the falsehood of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own opinions, and to counteract, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
conduct, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) most favourite maxims.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was born to overcome an
affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment
superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hand to another!--and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less
than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years
before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought
the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!

<p/>But so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible
passion, as once she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead
of remaining even for ever with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother, and finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) only
pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) more calm and
sober judgment she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had determined on,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) found herself at nineteen,
submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a new
home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.

<p/>Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>),
believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) deserved to be;--in Marianne he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was consoled for every past
affliction;--her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) regard and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) society restored his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) mind to animation,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own
happiness in forming his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), was equally the persuasion and delight of
each observing friend.  Marianne could never love by halves; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) husband, as it had
once been to Willoughby.

<p/>Willoughby could not hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) marriage without a pang; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of
Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) marriage with a woman of character, as
the source of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clemency, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) reason for believing that had he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
behaved with honour towards Marianne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) might at once have been happy
and rich.  That his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its
own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) long
thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was for ever inconsolable, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) fled from society, or
contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must
not be depended on--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) did neither.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) lived to exert, and
frequently to enjoy himself.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) wife was not always out of humour,
nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) home always uncomfortable; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) breed of horses and dogs,
and in sporting of every kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) found no inconsiderable degree of
domestic felicity.

<p/>For Marianne, however--in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) incivility in surviving her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
loss--he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) always retained that decided regard which interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) in
every thing that befell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) secret standard of
perfection in woman;--and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without
attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.
Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an
age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being
supposed to have a lover.

<p/>Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication
which strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the
merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked
as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost
within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement
between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.
