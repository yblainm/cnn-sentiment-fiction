He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . '' ","i":5984},{"w":"`` I hope , Marianne , '' ","i":6176},{"w":"`` you do not consider him as deficient in general taste .

The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ?

Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank .

'' ","i":20921},{"w":"`` You have said so , '' ","i":20947},{"w":"`` almost every day since they first met on High-church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . '' ","i":20957},{"w":"`` But , indeed , Elinor , it is Marianne 's . I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off . Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket-book . '' ","i":21060},{"w":"`` Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F.

'' ","i":23400},{"w":"`` I am afraid , '' ","i":24119},{"w":"`` that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . '' ","i":24128},{"w":"`` With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , I suppose , '' ","i":25726},{"w":"`` I flatter myself , '' ","i":25810},{"w":"`` that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this . '' ","i":25819},{"w":"`` Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor , '' ","i":27302},{"w":"`` and with how heavy a heart does he travel ? '' ","i":27326},{"w":"`` I want no proof of their affection , '' ","i":28189},{"w":"`` but of their engagement I do . '' ","i":28202},{"w":"`` I confess , '' ","i":28396},{"w":"`` that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement ; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . '' ","i":28404},{"w":"`` I hope not , I believe not , '' ","i":28726},{"w":"`` Remember , Elinor , '' ","i":29730},{"w":"`` how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it . We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John 's hands . '' ","i":29739},{"w":"`` I would not ask such a question for the world . Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! At any rate it would be most ungenerous . I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . I know Marianne 's heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . '' ","i":29933},{"w":"`` Indeed , Marianne , I think you are mistaken . It is not Willoughby . The person is not tall enough for him , and has not his air . '' ","i":30579},{"w":"`` Have you been lately in Sussex ? '' ","i":31101},{"w":"`` Dear , dear Norland , '' ","i":31138},{"w":"`` probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year . The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves . '' ","i":31148},{"w":"`` It is not every one , '' ","i":31259},{"w":"`` who has your passion for dead leaves . '' ","i":31270},{"w":"`` No ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood . But SOMETIMES they are . '' ","i":31280},{"w":"`` Now , Edward , '' ","i":31322},{"w":"`` here is Barton valley . Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can . Look at those hills ! Did you ever see their equals ?

'' ","i":31338},{"w":"`` Grandeur has but little , '' ","i":32155},{"w":"`` but wealth has much to do with it . '' ","i":32165},{"w":"`` Perhaps , '' ","i":32221},{"w":"`` we may come to the same point . YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ? '' ","i":32230},{"w":"`` About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than THAT . '' ","i":32294},{"w":"`` A family can not well be maintained on a smaller . I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands . A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less .

'' ","i":32518},{"w":"`` You must begin your improvements on this house , '' ","i":32597},{"w":"`` and your difficulties will soon vanish .

'' ","i":33085},{"w":"`` I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , '' ","i":33152},{"w":"`` in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated . Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves , and very frequently by what other people say of them , without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge . '' ","i":33168},{"w":"`` Quite the contrary , '' ","i":33411},{"w":"`` Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , '' ","i":33519},{"w":"`` Reserved ! -- how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ? What can you suppose ? '' ","i":33640},{"w":"`` I suspect , '' ","i":34290},{"w":"`` that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . '' ","i":34298},{"w":"`` Never mind if they do . It is only the Palmers . Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . You may see her if you look this way . '' ","i":37487},{"w":"`` but , however , I ca n't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know -LRB- nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter -RRB- it was wrong in her situation . I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! '' ","i":38318},{"w":"`` They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now , '' ","i":38972},{"w":"`` by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago . The alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull . We must look for the change elsewhere . '' ","i":38990},{"w":"`` He is always out of humour . '' ","i":40016},{"w":"`` But indeed you must and shall come . I am sure you will like it of all things . The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful . You can not think what a sweet place Cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before , it is quite charming ! But , poor fellow ! it is very fatiguing to him ! for he is forced to make every body like him . '' ","i":40351},{"w":"`` Certainly , '' ","i":40686},{"w":"`` he seems very agreeable .

I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you ca n't think how disappointed he will be if you do n't come to Cleveland . -- I ca n't imagine why you should object to it . '' ","i":40700},{"w":"`` Upon my word , '' ","i":41075},{"w":"`` you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match . '' ","i":41084},{"w":"`` Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ? '' ","i":41540},{"w":"`` I should guess so , '' ","i":43900},{"w":"`` from what I have witnessed this morning . '' ","i":43914},{"w":"`` I confess , '' ","i":43992},{"w":"`` that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence . '' ","i":44000},{"w":"`` I think every one MUST admire it , '' ","i":44147},{"w":"`` who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do . '' ","i":44160},{"w":"`` Upon my word , '' ","i":44459},{"w":"`` I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . '' ","i":44468},{"w":"`` and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon , -- but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . '' ","i":44953},{"w":"`` Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle 's , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . '' ","i":45312},{"w":"`` And who was this uncle ?

'' ","i":47217},{"w":"`` Four years you have been engaged , '' ","i":47328},{"w":"`` Yes ; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait . Poor Edward ! It puts him quite out of heart . '' ","i":47344},{"w":"`` To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face .

I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; '' ","i":48456},{"w":"`` You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual . -- He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible .

'' ","i":52488},{"w":"`` But what , '' ","i":52503},{"w":"`` are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars 's death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity ? -- Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? '' ","i":52515},{"w":"`` Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars ? '' ","i":52681},{"w":"`` I should always be happy , '' ","i":53103},{"w":"`` to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ?

I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to - ? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence .

This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! Where did you hear it ? '' ","i":71680},{"w":"`` Who can this be ? '' ","i":73357},{"w":"`` I understand you , '' ","i":73720},{"w":"`` Indeed , '' ","i":73973},{"w":"`` I have NOT forgotten it .

'' ","i":75998},{"w":"`` His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both . Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self-reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others . '' ","i":76009},{"w":"`` I have been more pained , '' ","i":76452},{"w":"`` by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . Have you , '' ","i":76463},{"w":"`` ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ? '' ","i":76524},{"w":"`` I could meet him no other way . Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct . We returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad . '' ","i":76580},{"w":"`` But I always thought I SHOULD . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD . '' ","i":79004},{"w":"`` Oh , yes , I dare say you will . '' ","i":79505},{"w":"`` Oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as Lucy and me ! -- I think she might see US ; and I am sure we would not speak a word . '' ","i":79656},{"w":"`` I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed . But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected . And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing .

Hers has been a very short one ! She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man . There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly . I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better . Dorsetshire ! I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors .

There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ? ' I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so I said , ` My dear Lady Elliott , do not be uneasy . The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease ; card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room ; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments ; and let the supper be set out in the saloon . ' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought . We measured the dining-room , and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple , and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan .

As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c. -- I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John .

It came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly . I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child ; -- he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne .

To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him ? -- Did you allow him to hope ? '' ","i":125233},{"w":"`` No . -- He thinks Marianne 's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . There , however , he is quite mistaken . His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed ; -- and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance . -- There was always a something , -- if you remember , -- in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I did not like .

Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that -- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage ? -- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ? '' ","i":130052},{"w":"`` The whole of his behaviour , '' ","i":130376},{"w":"`` from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness .

And why does he regret it ? -- Because he finds it has not answered towards himself . It has not made him happy . His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy ? -- The inconveniences would have been different . He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . '' ","i":130483},{"w":"`` One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams .

When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before . Your sister 's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind -- It is astonishing , when I reflect on what it was , and what SHE was , that my heart should have been so insensible ! But at first I must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it . Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection .

To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of ; -- and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty -- which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much -- I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it . -- But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not THEN know what it was to love . But have I ever known it ? -- Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice ? -- or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers ? -- But I have done it . To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing .

If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding -- I do not mean , however , to defend myself . Her affection for me deserved better treatment , and I often , with great self-reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return . I wish -- I heartily wish it had never been .

But yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mama , he has no real taste . Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat .

If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in THAT quarter . ` THERE , to be sure , ' said she , ' I might have thought myself safe . ' She was quite in an agony .

All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny 's entreaties , was of no avail . Duty , affection , every thing was disregarded . I never thought Edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before . His mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying Miss Morton ; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate , which , clear of land-tax , brings in a good thousand a-year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match . His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it .

' So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this . Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about -LRB- but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it -RRB- , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy ! -- There 's for you , my dear ! -- And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy ! -- Could you have believed such a thing possible ? -- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it ! -- THAT is strange ! -- I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter ; -- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well-meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out . ` Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ` they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride . She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on . Poor soul ! I pity HER . And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit . Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan , and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar . The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad . I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her . Lord ! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it ! To have his love used so scornfully ! for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion ! -- and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same . He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care . I have no pity for either of them . I have no notion of people 's making such a to-do about money and greatness . There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord ! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . '' ","i":93339},{"w":"`` Yes , ma'am . '' ","i":96363},{"w":"`` Then , '' ","i":97267},{"w":"`` he has acted like an honest man ! I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal . I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . '' ","i":97285},{"w":"`` Well , sir , '' ","i":97605},{"w":"`` and how did it end ? '' ","i":97615},{"w":"`` Poor young man ! '' ","i":97826},{"w":"`` I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him . It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . '' ","i":97836},{"w":"`` Well ! '' ","i":98037},{"w":"`` that is HER revenge . Everybody has a way of their own . But I do n't think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me . '' ","i":98045},{"w":"`` Ah ! Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods ; '' ","i":102637},{"w":"`` for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers ; -- and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back ! -- Lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats . '' ","i":102680},{"w":"`` Lord ! what should hinder it ? '' ","i":103092},{"w":"`` The smallness of the house , '' ","i":104031},{"w":"`` I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . '' ","i":104042},{"w":"`` This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry . I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness . His marriage must still be a distant good ; -- at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon . -- '' ","i":104123},{"w":"`` Well , Miss Dashwood , '' ","i":104358},{"w":"`` Opportunity ! '' ","i":104581},{"w":"`` Oh ! as to that , when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing , somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity .

'' ","i":104589},{"w":"`` Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out . But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it . '' ","i":104792},{"w":"`` Oh ! very well , '' ","i":104910},{"w":"`` No , ma'am , not even Lucy if you please . One day 's delay will not be very material ; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars , I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else . I shall do THAT directly . It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination . '' ","i":104947},{"w":"`` Oh , ho ! -- I understand you . Mr. Ferrars is to be the man . Well , so much the better for him . Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you . But , my dear , is not this rather out of character ? Should not the Colonel write himself ? -- sure , he is the proper person . '' ","i":105075},{"w":"`` Two or three months ! '' ","i":107064},{"w":"`` Lord ! my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months ! Lord bless me ! -- I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience ! -- And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already . '' ","i":107075},{"w":"`` Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , '' ","i":107295},{"w":"`` and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds ! -- and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage ! -- It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it . '' ","i":107323},{"w":"`` I do think , '' ","i":137829},{"w":"`` nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world ; -- so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again . And I must say that Lucy 's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all . Poor Mr. Edward !
