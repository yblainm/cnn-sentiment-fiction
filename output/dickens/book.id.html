<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS (<font color='blue'><b>FAGIN</b></font>) BIRTH

<p/>Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons
it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will
assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns,
great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on
a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as
it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of
the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is
prefixed to the head of this chapter.

<p/>For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and
trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable
doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which
case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never
have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of
pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the
most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the
literature of any age or country.

<p/>Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a
workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance
that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this
particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could
by possibility have occurred.  The fact is, that there was considerable
difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of
respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered
necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lay gasping on a
little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and
the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.  Now,
if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful
grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of
profound wisdom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would most inevitably and indubitably have been
killed in no time.  There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old
woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;
and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and
Nature fought out the point between them.  The result was, that, after
a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise
to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been
imposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could
reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been
possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer
space of time than three minutes and a quarter.

<p/>As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron
bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly
from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,
<div class="bookquote">`Let me see the child, and die.'

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The surgeon had been sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) face turned towards the fire:
giving the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hands a warm and a rub alternately.  As the
young woman spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with
more kindness than might have been expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Lor bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear heart, no!'  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>interposed the nurse, hastily
depositing in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Lor bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear heart, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has lived as long as I have, sir,
and had thirteen children of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own, and all on 'em dead except two,
and them in the wurkus with me, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll know better than to take on in
that way, bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear heart!  Think what it is to be a mother,
there's a dear young lamb do.'

 (<font color='red'><b>a mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's prospects failed
in producing its due effect.  The patient shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head, and stretched
out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand towards the child.

<p/>The surgeon deposited it in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms.  She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) imprinted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cold white
lips passionately on its forehead; passed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face;
gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back--and died. They chafed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever.  They
talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's all over, Mrs. Thingummy!'  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>said the surgeon at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, poor dear, so it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse, picking up the cork of the
green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) stooped to
take up the child.  <div class="bookquote">`Poor dear!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You needn't mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,'  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>said
the surgeon, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) gloves with great deliberation. <div class="bookquote">`It's very
likely it _will_ be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.'   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
put on his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) way to the door,
added, <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was a good-looking girl, too; where did she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) come from?'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was brought here last night,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the old woman, <div class="bookquote">`by the
overseer's order.  She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was found lying in the street.  She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had walked
some distance, for her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) shoes were worn to pieces; but where she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) came
from, or where she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was going to, nobody knows.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.  <div class="bookquote">`The old
story,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) head: <div class="bookquote">`no wedding-ring, I see. Ah!
Good-night!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once
more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair
before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.

<p/>What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist
was!  Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) only
covering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it
would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) proper station in society.  But now that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was enveloped in the
old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was
badged and ticketed, and fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) place at once--a parish
child--the orphan of a workhouse--the humble, half-starved drudge--to
be cuffed and buffeted through the world--despised by all, and pitied
by none.

<p/>Oliver cried lustily. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was an orphan,
left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
would have cried the louder.



<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD

<p/>For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic
course of treachery and deception.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was brought up by hand.  The
hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported
by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities.  The parish
authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether
there was no female then domiciled in <div class="bookquote">`the house'  (<font color='red'><b>the workhouse authorities</b></font>)</div>who was in a
situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) stood in need.  The workhouse authorities replied with
humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities
magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be <div class="bookquote">`farmed,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>or, in other words, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse
some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders
against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the
inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental
superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and
for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.
Sevenpence-halfpenny's worth per week is a good round diet for a child;
a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to
overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was
a woman of wisdom and experience; she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) knew what was good for children;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.
So, she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) own
use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter
allowance than was originally provided for them.  Thereby finding in
the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great
experimental philosopher.

<p/>Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a
great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who
demonstrated it so well, that he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) own horse down to a straw
a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) a very spirited and
rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) had not died,
four-and-twenty hours before he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) was to have had his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) first comfortable
bait of air.  Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the
female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a
similar result usually attended the operation of _her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)_ system; for at
the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest
possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen
in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want
and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by
accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was
usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers
it had never known in this.

<p/>Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest
upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead,
or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a
washing--though the latter accident was very scarce, anything
approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm--the jury
would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the
parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a
remonstrance.  But these impertinences were speedily checked by the
evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of
whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside -LRB-which was
very probable indeed-RRB-, and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever
the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional.  Besides, the board
made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the
day before, to say they were going.  The children were neat and clean
to behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have!

<p/>It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any
very extraordinary or luxuriant crop.  Oliver Twist's ninth birthday
found him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and
decidedly small in circumference.  But nature or inheritance had
implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver's breast.  It had had plenty
of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and
perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) having any ninth
birth-day at all.  Be this as it may, however, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ninth
birthday; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party
of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in a
sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be
hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly
startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo
the wicket of the garden-gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Goodness gracious!  Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann,
thrusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.
<div class="bookquote">`-LRB-Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash 'em
directly.-RRB---My heart alive!  Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you,
sure-ly!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of
responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) gave
the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick
which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Lor, only think,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, running out,--for the three boys had
been removed by this time,--`only think of that!  That I should have
forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them
dear children!  Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.'

<p/>Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have
softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the
beadle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired
Mr. Bumble, grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane, <div class="bookquote">`to keep the parish officers a waiting
at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with
the porochial orphans?  Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I
may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear
children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs.
Mann with great humility.

<p/>Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) oratorical powers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
importance.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
relaxed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well, Mrs. Mann,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) replied in a calmer tone; <div class="bookquote">`it may be as you
say; it may be.  Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business,
and have something to say.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor;
placed a seat for him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>); and officiously deposited his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) cocked hat and
cane on the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>).  Mr. Bumble wiped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) forehead the
perspiration which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the
cocked hat, and smiled.  Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) smiled.  Beadles are but men: and Mr.
Bumble smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now don't you be offended at what I'm a going to say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs.
Mann, with captivating sweetness.  <div class="bookquote">`You've had a long walk, you know,
or I wouldn't mention it.  Now, will you take a little drop of
somethink, Mr. Bumble?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a drop.  Nor a drop,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) right hand in a
dignified, but placid manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I think you will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the
refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it.  <div class="bookquote">`Just a leetle drop,
with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble coughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, just a leetle drop,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann persuasively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>inquired the beadle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put
into the blessed infants'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Daffy, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,'
replied Mrs. Mann as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) opened a corner cupboard, and took down a
bottle and glass.  <div class="bookquote">`It's gin.  I'll not deceive you, Mr. B.  It's gin.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Bumble, following
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes the interesting process of mixing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, bless 'em, that I do, dear as it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>replied the nurse. <div class="bookquote">`I
couldn't see 'em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; <div class="bookquote">`no, you could not.  You are a
humane woman, Mrs. Mann.'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) set down the glass.-RRB-  <div class="bookquote">`I shall
take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) drew it towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).-RRB-  <div class="bookquote">`You feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.'   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
stirred the gin-and-water.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`I--I drink your health with cheerfulness,
Mrs. Mann' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) swallowed half of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And now about business,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, taking out a leathern
pocket-book.  <div class="bookquote">`The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine
year old to-day.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Bless him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) left eye with the
corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) apron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was
afterwards increased to twenty pound.  Notwithstanding the most
superlative, and, I may say, supernat`ral exertions on the part of this
parish,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`we have never been able to discover who is his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
father, or what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mother's settlement, name, or condition.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Mann raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment's
reflection, <div class="bookquote">`How comes he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) to have any name at all, then?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div><p/>The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, <div class="bookquote">`I inwented it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You, Mr. Bumble!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I, Mrs. Mann.  We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last
was a S,--Swubble, I named him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>). This was a T,--Twist, I named _him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)_.
The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins.  I have got
names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it
again, when we come to Z.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, you're quite a literary character, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment;
<div class="bookquote">`perhaps I may be.  Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) finished the
gin-and-water, and added, <div class="bookquote">`Oliver being now too old to remain here, the
board have determined to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) back into the house.  I have come out
myself to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) there.  So let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) at once.'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) directly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that
purpose.  Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of
dirt which encrusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed
off in one washing, was led into the room by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) benevolent protectress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann.

<p/>Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair,
and the cocked hat on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Will you go along with me, Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic
voice.

<p/>Oliver was about to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would go along with anybody with great
readiness, when, glancing upward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had
got behind the beadle's chair, and was shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) fist at him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) with a
furious countenance.  He (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) took the hint at once, for the fist had been
too often impressed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) body not to be deeply impressed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>)
recollection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) go with me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired poor Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) can't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>)'ll come and see you
sometimes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>This was no very great consolation to the child.  Young as he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at
going away.  It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears
into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes.  Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you
want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed.  Mrs. Mann gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a
piece of bread and butter, less he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should seem too hungry when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) got
to the workhouse. With the slice of bread in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand, and the little
brown-cloth parish cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.
Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never
lighted the gloom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) infant years.  And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) burst into an agony
of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  Wretched as
were the little companions in misery he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was leaving behind, they were
the only friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever known; and a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) loneliness in
the great wide world, sank into the child's heart for the first time.

<p/>Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), inquiring at the end of every
quarter of a mile whether they were <div class="bookquote">`nearly there.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>To these
interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for
the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had
by this time evaporated; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was once again a beadle.

<p/>Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an
hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of
bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) over to the care of an old
woman, returned; and, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) it was a board night, informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
that the board had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was to appear before it forthwith.

<p/>Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was,
Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite
certain whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ought to laugh or cry.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had no time to think
about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) a tap on the head,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane, to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) up: and another on the back to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
lively: and bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) to follow, conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) into a large
white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round
a table.  At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher
than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bow to the board,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Bumble.  Oliver brushed away two or three
tears that were lingering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes; and seeing no board but the
table, fortunately bowed to that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's your name, boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the high chair.

<p/>Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
tremble: and the beadle gave him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) another tap behind, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>)
cry.  These two causes made him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) answer in a very low and hesitating
voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a fool.
Which was a capital way of raising his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spirits, and putting him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quite
at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the high chair, <div class="bookquote">`listen to me. You know
you're an orphan, I suppose?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What's that, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired poor Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The boy _is_ a fool--I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the
white waistcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman who had spoken first.  <div class="bookquote">`You know you've got
no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don't
you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What are you crying for?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>inquired the gentleman in the white
waistcoat.  And to be sure it was very extraordinary.  What _could_ the
boy be crying for?

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope you say your prayers every night,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said another gentleman in a
gruff voice; <div class="bookquote">`and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of
you--like a Christian.'

 (<font color='red'><b>another gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>stammered the boy.  The gentleman who spoke last was
unconsciously right.  It would have been very like a Christian, and a
marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people
who fed and took care of _him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)_. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hadn't, because nobody had
taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well!  You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So you'll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o'clock,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added
the surly one in the white waistcoat.

<p/>For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process
of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and
was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
sobbed himself to sleep.  What a novel illustration of the tender laws
of England!  They let the paupers go to sleep!

<p/>Poor Oliver!  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) little thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lay sleeping in happy
unconsciousness of all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), that the board had that very day
arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence
over all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) future fortunes.  But they had.  And this was it:

<p/>The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and
when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out
at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered--the poor
people liked it!  It was a regular place of public entertainment for
the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public
breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and
mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work.  <div class="bookquote">`Oho!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
board, looking very knowing; <div class="bookquote">`we are the fellows to set this to rights;
we'll stop it all, in no time.'   (<font color='red'><b>all people</b></font>)</div>So, they established the rule, that
all poor people should have the alternative -LRB-for they would compel
nobody, not they-RRB-, of being starved by a gradual process in the house,
or by a quick one out of it.  With this view, they contracted with the
water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a
corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and
issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and
half a roll of Sundays.  They made a great many other wise and humane
regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary
to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in
consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors' Commons; and,
instead of compelling a man to support his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, as they had
theretofore done, took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a
bachelor!  There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under
these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society,
if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were
long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty.  The relief was
inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened
people.

<p/>For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was
in full operation.  It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of
the increase in the undertaker's bill, and the necessity of taking in
the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their
wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two's gruel.  But the number of
workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were
in ecstasies.

<p/>The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a
copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the
purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at
mealtimes.  Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and
no more--except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had two
ounces and a quarter of bread besides.

<p/>The bowls never wanted washing.  The boys polished them with their
spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this
operation -LRB-which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large
as the bowls-RRB-, they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager
eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was
composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers
most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of
gruel that might have been cast thereon.  Boys have generally excellent
appetites. Oliver Twist and his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) companions suffered the tortures of
slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and
wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) age, and hadn't
been used to that sort of thing -LRB-for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father had kept a small
cook-shop-RRB-, hinted darkly to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) companions, that unless he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had another
basin of gruel per diem, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might some night happen to
eat the boy who slept next him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), who happened to be a weakly youth of
tender age.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the
master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to
Oliver Twist.

<p/>The evening arrived; the boys took their places.  The master, in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
cook's uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pauper assistants
ranged themselves behind him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); the gruel was served out; and a long
grace was said over the short commons.  The gruel disappeared; the boys
whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) next neighbors
nudged him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  Child as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was desperate with hunger, and
reckless with misery.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) rose from the table; and advancing to the
master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own
temerity:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Please, sir, I want some more.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the master basin spoon</b></font>)</div><p/>The master was a fat, healthy man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) turned very pale. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gazed in
stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then
clung for support to the copper.  The assistants were paralysed with
wonder; the boys with fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master at length, in a faint voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Please, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, <div class="bookquote">`I want some more.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>The master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle; pinioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.

<p/>The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into
the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high
chair, said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir!  Oliver Twist has asked for
more!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a general start.  Horror was depicted on every countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`For _more_!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Limbkins.  <div class="bookquote">`Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer
me distinctly.  Do I understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Limbkins</b></font>) asked for more, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Limbkins</b></font>) had
eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Limbkins</b></font>) did, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That boy will be hung,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  <div class="bookquote">`I
know that boy will be hung.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman's opinion.  An animated
discussion took place.  Oliver was ordered into instant confinement;
and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering
a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the
hands of the parish.  In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were
offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade,
business, or calling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I never was more convinced of anything in my life,'  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman
in the white waistcoat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knocked at the gate and read the bill
next morning: <div class="bookquote">`I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than
I am that that boy will come to be hung.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated
gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this
narrative -LRB-supposing it to possess any at all-RRB-, if I ventured to hint
just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination
or no.



<p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN A SINECURE

<p/>For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of
asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and
solitary room to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of
the board.  It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose,
that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the
prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would have
established that sage individual's prophetic character, once and for
ever, by tying one end of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the
wall, and attaching himself to the other.  To the performance of this
feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that
pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for
all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the
express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and
pronounced under their hands and seals.  There was a still greater
obstacle in Oliver's youth and childishness.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) only cried bitterly
all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) little
hands before his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the
corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble,
and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even
its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness
which surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/>Let it not be supposed by the enemies of <div class="bookquote">`the system,'  (<font color='red'><b>the enemies</b></font>)</div>that, during the
period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of
exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious
consolation.  As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was
allowed to perform his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ablutions every morning under the pump, in a
stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) catching
cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) frame, by repeated
applications of the cane.  As for society, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was carried every other
day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a
public warning and example.  And so far from being denied the
advantages of religious consolation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was kicked into the same
apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen
to, and console his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mind with, a general supplication of the boys,
containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the
board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented,
and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver
Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the
exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an
article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.

<p/>It chanced one morning, while Oliver's affairs were in this auspicious
and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) way
down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) ways and means
of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) landlord had become
rather pressing.  Mr. Gamfield's most sanguine estimate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) finances
could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount;
and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) was alternately
cudgelling his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) brains and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) donkey, when passing the workhouse, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>)
eyes encountered the bill on the gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Wo--o!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.

<p/>The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably,
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was
laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) jogged onward.

<p/>Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but
more particularly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) eyes; and, running after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>), bestowed a blow
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a
donkey's.  Then, catching hold of the bridle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) jaw a sharp
wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) own master; and
by these means turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) round.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) then gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) another blow on the
head, just to stun him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) came back again.  Having completed these
arrangements, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) walked up to the gate, to read the bill.

<p/>The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), after having delivered himself of some profound
sentiments in the board-room.  Having witnessed the little dispute
between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) smiled joyously when that
person came up to read the bill, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) saw at once that Mr. Gamfield
was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.  Mr. Gamfield
smiled, too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) perused the document; for five pounds was just the
sum he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was
encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse
was, well knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing
for register stoves.  So, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) spelt the bill through again, from
beginning to end; and then, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) fur cap in token of humility,
accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.

<p/>`This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to <div class="bookquote">`prentis,'  (<font color='red'><b>boy sir</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Gamfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ay, my man,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a
condescending smile.  <div class="bookquote">`What of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>`If the parish vould like him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) to learn a right pleasant trade, in a
good <div class="bookquote">`spectable chimbley-sweepin'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>bisness,' said Mr. Gamfield, `I wants
a <div class="bookquote">`prentis, and I am ready to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Walk in,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  Mr. Gamfield
having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head,
and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>)
absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room
where Oliver had first seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's a nasty trade,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) wish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,'  (<font color='red'><b>another gentleman</b></font>)</div>said another
gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley
to make 'em come down again,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>said Gamfield; <div class="bookquote">`that's all smoke, and no
blaze; vereas smoke ain't o'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>no use at all in making a boy come down,
for it only sinds him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to sleep, and that's wot he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) likes.  Boys is wery
obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen`l'men, and there's nothink like a good hot
blaze to make 'em come down vith a run.  It's humane too, gen`l'men,
acause, even if they've stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet
makes 'em struggle to hextricate theirselves.'

<p/>The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this
explanation; but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr.
Limbkins.  The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a
few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words <div class="bookquote">`saving of
expenditure,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`looked well in the accounts,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`have a printed report
published,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were alone audible.  These only chanced to be heard,
indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great
emphasis.

<p/>At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having
resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We have considered your proposition, and we don't approve of it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Decidedly not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the members</b></font>)</div>added the other members.

<p/>As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of
having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>)
that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into
their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their
proceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business,
if they had; but still, as he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) had no particular wish to revive the
rumour, he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) cap in his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) hands, and walked slowly from the
table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So you won't let me have him (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>), gen`l'men?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gamfield, pausing
near the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Limbkins; <div class="bookquote">`at least, as it's a nasty business, we
think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gamfield's countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>)
returned to the table, and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What'll you give, gen`l'men?  Come!  Don't be too hard on a poor man.
What'll you give?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I should say, three pound ten was plenty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Limbkins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ten shillings too much,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>said Gamfield; <div class="bookquote">`say four pound, gen`l'men.  Say four pound, and
you've got rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) for good and all.  There!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Three pound ten,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come!  I'll split the diff`erence, gen`l'men,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>urged Gamfield. <div class="bookquote">`Three
pound fifteen.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a farthing more,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You're desperate hard upon me, gen`l'men,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>said Gamfield, wavering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Pooh!  pooh!  nonsense!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
<div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), you silly
fellow!  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s just the boy for you.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wants the stick, now and then:
it'll do him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) good; and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) board needn't come very expensive, for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
hasn't been overfed since he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was born.  Ha!  ha!  ha!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and,
observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.
The bargain was made.  Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver
Twist and his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for
signature and approval, that very afternoon.

<p/>In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) excessive
astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself
into a clean shirt.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic
performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) own hands, a basin
of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of
bread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously:
thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) up in that way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. `You're a going to
be made a <div class="bookquote">`prentice of, Oliver.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A prentice, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child, trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.  `The kind and blessed gentleman which
is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are
a going to <div class="bookquote">`prentice'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of
you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!--three
pound ten, Oliver!--seventy shillins--one hundred and forty
sixpences!--and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can't love.'

<p/>As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in
an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child's face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
sobbed bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) feelings to observe the effect his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eloquence had produced;
<div class="bookquote">`Come, Oliver!  Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don't
cry into your gruel; that's a very foolish action, Oliver.'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>It
certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.

<p/>On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the
gentleman asked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wanted to be apprenticed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should like
it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey:
the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) failed in
either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>). When
they arrived at the office, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was shut up in a little room by himself,
and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) came back to fetch
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).

<p/>There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour.  At
the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head, unadorned
with the cocked hat, and said aloud:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>As Mr. Bumble said
this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice,
<div class="bookquote">`Mind what I told you, you young rascal!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble's face at this somewhat
contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
offering any remark thereupon, by leading him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) at once into an adjoining
room: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great
window.  Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one
of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with
the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of
parchment which lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).  Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of
the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face,
on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were
lounging about.

<p/>The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the
little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had
been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is the boy, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.

<p/>The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head for a
moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon,
the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, is this the boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`Bow to the magistrate, my
dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver roused himself, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) best obeisance.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been
wondering, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes fixed on the magistrates' powder, whether all
boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards
from thenceforth on that account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s fond of
chimney-sweeping?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) doats on it, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly
pinch, to intimate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had better not say he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) didn't.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) _will_ be a sweep, will he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>inquired the old gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If we was to bind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to any other trade to-morrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d run away
simultaneous, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And this man that's to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master--you, sir--you'll treat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) well,
and feed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and do all that sort of thing, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old
gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`When I says I will, I means I will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You're a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest,
open-hearted man,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman: turning his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles in
the direction of the candidate for Oliver's premium, whose villainous
countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty.  But the
magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) couldn't reasonably
be expected to discern what other people did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope I am, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I have no doubt you are, my friend,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>replied the old gentleman: fixing
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles more firmly on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nose, and looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for the
inkstand.

<p/>It was the critical moment of Oliver's fate.  If the inkstand had been
where the old gentleman thought it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would have dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pen
into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been
straightway hurried off.  But, as it chanced to be immediately under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looked all over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
search to look straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) gaze encountered the pale and
terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks
and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too
palpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.

<p/>The old gentleman stopped, laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pen, and looked from Oliver to
Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and
unconcerned aspect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`My boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`you look pale and alarmed. What is
the matter?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Stand a little away from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), Beadle,'  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrate</b></font>)</div>said the other magistrate:
laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of
interest.  <div class="bookquote">`Now, boy, tell us what's the matter: don't be afraid.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knees, and clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands together, prayed that
they would order him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) back to the dark room--that they would starve
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)--beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)--kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) if they pleased--rather than send him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) away with
that dreadful man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hands and eyes with most
impressive solemnity.  <div class="bookquote">`Well! of all the artful and designing orphans
that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue, Beadle,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the second old gentleman, when Mr.
Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I beg your worship's pardon,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having
heard aright.  <div class="bookquote">`Did your worship speak to me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes.  Hold your tongue.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment.  A beadle ordered to hold
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) tongue!  A moral revolution!

<p/>The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
companion, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nodded significantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We refuse to sanction these indentures,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman:
tossing aside the piece of parchment as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>stammered Mr. Limbkins:  <div class="bookquote">`I hope the magistrates will not
form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper
conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the
matter,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the second old gentleman sharply.  <div class="bookquote">`Take the boy back to
the workhouse, and treat him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) kindly.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seems to want it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively
and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
head with gloomy mystery, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) might come to good;
whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) might come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>);
which, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem
to be a wish of a totally opposite description.

<p/>The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was
again To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would
take possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC
LIFE

<p/>In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained,
either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the
young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
sea.  The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took
counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in
some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port.  This
suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>): the probability being, that the skipper would flog him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) to
death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>)
brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty
generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman
of that class.  The more the case presented itself to the board, in
this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step
appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of
providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to sea without delay.

<p/>Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries,
with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a
cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to
communicate the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mission; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) encountered at the gate,
no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.

<p/>Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit
of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour,
and shoes to answer.  His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features were not naturally intended to wear
a smiling aspect, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in general rather given to professional
jocosity.  His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) step was elastic, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face betokened inward
pleasantry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cordially by
the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr.
Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>)
thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the
undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin.  <div class="bookquote">`I
say you'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker model</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Bumble,
tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>)
cane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Think so?'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half
disputed the probability of the event.  <div class="bookquote">`The prices allowed by the
board are very small, Mr. Bumble.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So are the coffins,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle: with precisely as near an
approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.

<p/>Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) ought to be;
and laughed a long time without cessation.  <div class="bookquote">`Well, well, Mr. Bumble,'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) said at length, <div class="bookquote">`there's no denying that, since the new system of
feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more
shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble.
Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron
handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`every trade has its drawbacks. A fair
profit is, of course, allowable.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the undertaker; <div class="bookquote">`and if I don't get a
profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the
long-run, you see--he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Just so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Though I must say,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>continued the undertaker, resuming the current of
observations which the beadle had interrupted: <div class="bookquote">`though I must say, Mr.
Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage:
which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest.  The people
who have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the
first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr.
Bumble, that three or four inches over one's calculation makes a great
hole in one's profits: especially when one has a family to provide for,
sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an
ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a
reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it
advisable to change the subject.  Oliver Twist being uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>)
mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) theme.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`By the bye,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, `you don't know anybody who wants a boy,
do you?  A porochial <div class="bookquote">`prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a
millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat?  Liberal terms,
Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms?'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>As Mr. Bumble spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
cane to the bill above him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), and gave three distinct raps upon the words
<div class="bookquote">`five pounds' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>:  which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of
gigantic size.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Gadso!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged
lappel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) official coat; <div class="bookquote">`that's just the very thing I wanted to
speak to you about.  You know--dear me, what a very elegant button this
is, Mr. Bumble!  I never noticed it before.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, I think it rather pretty,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, glancing proudly
downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) coat. <div class="bookquote">`The
die is the same as the porochial seal--the Good Samaritan healing the
sick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear's
morning, Mr. Sowerberry.  I put it on, I remember, for the first time,
to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway
at midnight.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I recollect,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker. <div class="bookquote">`The jury brought it in, ``Died from
exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,''
didn't they?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And they made it a special verdict, I think,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker, <div class="bookquote">`by
adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Tush!  Foolery!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>interposed the beadle.  <div class="bookquote">`If the board attended to all
the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they'd have enough to do.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Very true,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker; <div class="bookquote">`they would indeed.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Juries,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane tightly, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wont
when working into a passion: <div class="bookquote">`juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling
wretches.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So they are,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`They haven't no more philosophy nor political economy about 'em than
that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) fingers contemptuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No more they have,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>acquiesced the undertaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I despise 'em,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, growing very red in the face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So do I,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>rejoined the undertaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And I only wish we'd a jury of the independent sort, in the house for
a week or two,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle; <div class="bookquote">`the rules and regulations of the
board would soon bring their spirit down for 'em.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Let 'em alone for that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the undertaker.  So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>)
smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish
officer.

<p/>Mr Bumble lifted off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the
inside of the crown; wiped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) forehead the perspiration which his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)
rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the
undertaker, said in a calmer voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well; what about the boy?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the undertaker; <div class="bookquote">`why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good
deal towards the poor's rates.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hem!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`Well?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the undertaker, <div class="bookquote">`I was thinking that if I pay so much
towards 'em, I've a right to get as much out of 'em as I can, Mr.
Bumble; and so--I think I'll take the boy myself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) into the
building.  Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes;
and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) that evening <div class="bookquote">`upon
liking' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that
if the master find, upon a short trial, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) can get enough work out
of a boy without putting too much food into him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) shall have him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) for
a term of years, to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) likes with.

<p/>When little Oliver was taken before <div class="bookquote">`the gentlemen'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>that evening; and
informed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a
coffin-maker's; and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) complained of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) situation, or ever
came back to the parish again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would be sent to sea, there to be
drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) evinced so
little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a hardened
young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) forthwith.

<p/>Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the
world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror
at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they
were rather out, in this particular instance.  The simple fact was,
that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather
too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state
of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had received.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heard the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) destination, in perfect silence; and, having
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) luggage put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand--which was not very difficult to
carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown
paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep--he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pulled
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) cap over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble's
coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.

<p/>For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark;
for the beadle carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head very erect, as a beadle always should:
and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by
the skirts of Mr. Bumble's coat as they blew open, and disclosed to
great advantage his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches.  As
they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it
expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for
inspection by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) new master: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) accordingly did, with a fit and
becoming air of gracious patronage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oliver!'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Although Oliver did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was desired, at once; and passed the back of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) unoccupied hand briskly across his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) left a tear in them
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looked up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) conductor.  As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), it rolled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cheek. It was followed by another, and another.
The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one.
Withdrawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) other hand from Mr. Bumble's he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) face with
both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chin and
bony fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) little
charge a look of intense malignity.  <div class="bookquote">`Well!  Of _all_ the
ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are
the--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the
well-known cane; <div class="bookquote">`no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I
will, sir!  I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so--so--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So what?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So lonely, sir!  So very lonely!'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>cried the child.  <div class="bookquote">`Everybody hates
me.  Oh! sir, don't, don't pray be cross to me!'   (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div>The child beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) heart; and looked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) companion's face, with tears of
real agony.

<p/>Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver's piteous and helpless look, with some
astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky
manner; and after muttering something about <div class="bookquote">`that troublesome cough,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>bade Oliver dry his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) walked on with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in silence.

<p/>The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) shop, was
making some entries in his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) day-book by the light of a most appropriate
dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Aha!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in
the middle of a word; <div class="bookquote">`is that you, Bumble?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle.  <div class="bookquote">`Here! I've brought
the boy.'   (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Oliver made a bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! that's the boy, is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker:  raising the candle
above his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) head, to get a better view of Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Sowerberry, will
you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and
presented the form of a short, then, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish
countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`My dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, <div class="bookquote">`this is the boy from
the workhouse that I told you of.'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>Oliver bowed again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Dear me!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker's wife, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'s very small.'

 (<font color='red'><b>undertaker wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) _is_ rather small,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as
if it were his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fault that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was no bigger; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is small. There's no
denying it.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry--he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll grow.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!  I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) will,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the lady pettishly, <div class="bookquote">`on our victuals
and our drink.  I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they
always cost more to keep, than they're worth. However, men always think
they know best. There!  Get downstairs, little bag o'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>bones.'  With
this, the undertaker's wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down
a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the
ante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated <div class="bookquote">`kitchen' (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>; wherein sat a
slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very
much out of repair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Here, Charlotte,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down,
<div class="bookquote">`give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
hasn't come home since the morning, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) may go without 'em.  I dare
say the boy isn't too dainty to eat 'em--are you, boy?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was
trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a
plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/>I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen
Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.
I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver
tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine.  There is only
one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the
Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker's wife, when Oliver had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
supper: which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful
auguries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) future appetite: <div class="bookquote">`have you done?'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There being nothing eatable within his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) reach, Oliver replied in the
affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then come with me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty
lamp, and leading the way upstairs; <div class="bookquote">`your bed's under the counter.  You
don't mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn't much
matter whether you do or don't, for you can't sleep anywhere else.
Come; don't keep me here all night!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) new mistress.



<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES.  GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST
TIME, HE (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) MASTER'S BUSINESS

<p/>Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker's shop, set the lamp
down on a workman's bench, and gazed timidly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) with a feeling
of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) will be
at no loss to understand.  An unfinished coffin on black tressels,
which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like
that a cold tremble came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), every time his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes wandered in the
direction of the dismal object: from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) almost expected to see
some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mad with terror.
Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm
boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like
high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.
Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black
cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was
ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff
neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by
four black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and
hot.  The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins.  The
recess beneath the counter in which his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) flock mattress was thrust,
looked like a grave.

<p/>Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was
alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the
best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no
friends to care for, or to care for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).  The regret of no recent
separation was fresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind; the absence of no loved and
well-remembered face sank heavily into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wished, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) crept
into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) narrow bed, that that were his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coffin, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could be
lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the
tall grass waving gently above his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, and the sound of the old deep
bell to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sleep.

<p/>Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of
the shop-door: which, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could huddle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clothes, was
repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Open the door, will yer?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the voice which belonged to the legs
which had kicked at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I will, directly, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning
the key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I suppose yer the new boy, ain't yer?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the voice through the
key-hole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`How old are yer?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired the voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ten, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then I'll whop yer when I get in,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the voice; <div class="bookquote">`you just see if I
don't, that's all, my work`us brat!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and having made this obliging
promise, the voice began to whistle.

<p/>Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very
expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the
smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) might be, would
redeem his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) pledge, most honourably. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) drew back the bolts with a
trembling hand, and opened the door.

<p/>For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street,
and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had
addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm
himself; for nobody did he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post
in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) cut
into wedges, the size of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then
consumed with great dexterity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I beg your pardon, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Oliver at length: seeing that no other
visitor made his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) appearance; <div class="bookquote">`did you knock?'

 (<font color='red'><b>no visitor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I kicked,'  (<font color='red'><b>no visitor</b></font>)</div>replied the charity-boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Did you want a coffin, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver, innocently.

<p/>At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver
would want one before long, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) cut jokes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) superiors in that
way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yer don't know who I am, I suppose, Work`us?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the charity-boy, in
continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with
edifying gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>rejoined Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm Mister Noah Claypole,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the charity-boy, <div class="bookquote">`and you're under me.
Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>With this, Mr.
Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a
dignified air, which did him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) great credit.  It is difficult for a
large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy
countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more
especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red
nose and yellow smalls.

<p/>Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a
small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the
day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) with the
assurance that <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)'d catch it,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>condescended to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).  Mr.
Sowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry
appeared.  Oliver having <div class="bookquote">`caught it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>in fulfilment of Noah's
prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come near the fire, Noah,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.  <div class="bookquote">`I saved a nice little bit
of bacon for you from master's breakfast.  Oliver, shut that door at
Mister Noah's back, and take them bits that I've put out on the cover
of the bread-pan.  There's your tea; take it away to that box, and
drink it there, and make haste, for they'll want you to mind the shop.
D'ye hear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>'D`ye hear, Work`us?' said Noah Claypole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Lor, Noah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">`what a rum creature you are!  Why don't
you let the boy alone?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) alone!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`Why everybody lets him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) alone enough, for
the matter of that.  Neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) father nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) mother will ever
interfere with him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).  All his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) relations let him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) own way pretty
well.  Eh, Charlotte?  He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, you queer soul!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully
at poor Oliver Twist, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) sat shivering on the box in the coldest
corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially
reserved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).

<p/>Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan.  No chance-child
was he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) could trace his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) genealogy all the way back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)
parents, who lived hard by; his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) mother being a washerwoman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)
father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal
pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction.  The
shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding
Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of
<div class="bookquote">`leathers,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`charity,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>and the like; and Noah had bourne them without
reply.  But, now that fortune had cast in his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) way a nameless orphan, at
whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) retorted on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) with interest.  This affords charming food for contemplation.  It
shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how
impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord
and the dirtiest charity-boy.

<p/>Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker's some three weeks or a
month.  Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry--the shop being shut up--were taking
their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after
several deferential glances at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) wife, said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`My dear--'   (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up,
with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) stopped short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing, my dear, nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ugh, you brute!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not at all, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry humbly.  <div class="bookquote">`I thought you
didn't want to hear, my dear.  I was only going to say--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, don't tell me what you were going to say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs.
Sowerberry.  <div class="bookquote">`I am nobody; don't consult me, pray.  _I_ don't want to
intrude upon your secrets.'   (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) gave an
hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Sowerberry, <div class="bookquote">`I want to ask your advice.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, don't ask mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting
manner: <div class="bookquote">`ask somebody else's.'   (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>Here, there was another hysterical
laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much.  This is a very
common and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is
often very effective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as
a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most
curious to hear.  After a short duration, the permission was most
graciously conceded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's only about young Twist, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">`A very
good-looking boy, that, my dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) need be, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) eats enough,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>observed the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There's an expression of melancholy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) face, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>resumed Mr.
Sowerberry, <div class="bookquote">`which is very interesting.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) would make a delightful
mute, my love.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable
wonderment.  Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for
any observation on the good lady's part, proceeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but
only for children's practice.  It would be very new to have a mute in
proportion, my dear.  You may depend upon it, it would have a superb
effect.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way,
was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been
compromising her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious
suggestion had not presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) husband's mind before?  Mr.
Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>)
proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should
be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this
view, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) should accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) master on the very next occasion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) services being required.

<p/>The occasion was not long in coming.  Half an hour after breakfast next
morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane against
the counter, drew forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) large leathern pocket-book: from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
selected a small scrap of paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) handed over to Sowerberry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Aha!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance;
<div class="bookquote">`an order for a coffin, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr.
Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like
himself, was very corpulent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bayton,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.
Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`I never heard the name before.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Bumble shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">`Obstinate people, Mr.
Sowerberry; very obstinate.  Proud, too, I'm afraid, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Proud, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer.  <div class="bookquote">`Come, that's too
much.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, it's sickening,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle.  <div class="bookquote">`Antimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>acquiesced the undertaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We only heard of the family the night before last,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle;
`and we shouldn't have known anything about them, then, only a woman
who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial
committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was
very bad.  He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had gone out to dinner; but his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">`prentice -LRB-which is a
very clever lad-RRB- sent 'em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, there's promptness,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Promptness, indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle.  <div class="bookquote">`But what's the consequence;
what's the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir?  Why, the husband
sends back word that the medicine won't suit his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's complaint, and
so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shan't take it--says she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shan't take it, sir!  Good, strong,
wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish
labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before--sent 'em for nothing,
with a blackin' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-bottle in,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sends back word that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shan't take
it, sir!'

<p/>As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble's mind in full force, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
struck the counter sharply with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane, and became flushed with
indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker, <div class="bookquote">`I ne--ver--did--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Never did, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the beadle.  <div class="bookquote">`No, nor nobody never did;
but now she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s dead, we've got to bury her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and that's the direction;
and the sooner it's done, the better.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat wrong side first, in a
fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was so angry, Oliver, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forgot even to ask after you!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) strode down the
street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of
sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at
the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble's voice.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) needn't haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble's glance,
however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman
in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that
now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better
avoided, until such time as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should be firmly bound for seven years,
and all danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) being returned upon the hands of the parish
should be thus effectually and legally overcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) hat, <div class="bookquote">`the sooner this job is
done, the better.  Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your cap,
and come with me.'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>Oliver obeyed, and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
professional mission.

<p/>They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely
inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street
more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused
to look for the house which was the object of their search.  The houses
on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by
people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have
sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the
squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies
half doubled, occasionally skulked along.  A great many of the
tenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering
away; only the upper rooms being inhabited.  Some houses which had
become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into
the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly
planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been
selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of
the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were
wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for
the passage of a human body.  The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The
very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were
hideous with famine.

<p/>There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master stopped; so, groping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) way cautiously through the dark
passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and not be afraid the
undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs.  Stumbling
against a door on the landing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) rapped at it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knuckles.

<p/>It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen.  The undertaker
at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the
apartment to which he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had been directed.  He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) stepped in; Oliver
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/>There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically,
over the empty stove.  An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the
cold hearth, and was sitting beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). There were some ragged
children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door,
there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket.
Oliver shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes toward the place, and crept
involuntarily closer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master; for though it was covered up, the
boy felt that it was a corpse.

<p/>The man's face was thin and very pale; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair and beard were grizzly;
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were bloodshot.  The old woman's face was wrinkled; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) two
remaining teeth protruded over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) under lip; and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes were bright
and piercing.  Oliver was afraid to look at either her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) or the man.
They seemed so like the rats he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had seen outside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nobody shall go near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, starting fiercely up, as the
undertaker approached the recess. <div class="bookquote">`Keep back! Damn you, keep back, if
you've a life to lose!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nonsense, my good man,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker, who was pretty well used
to misery in all its shapes.  <div class="bookquote">`Nonsense!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I tell you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man:  clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and stamping
furiously on the floor,--'I tell you I won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put into the
ground.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) couldn't rest there.  The worms would worry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--not eat
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is so worn away.'

<p/>The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape
from his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees at
the feet of the dead woman; <div class="bookquote">`kneel down, kneel down--kneel round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
every one of you, and mark my words!  I say she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was starved to death.
I never knew how bad she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was, till the fever came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and then
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bones were starting through the skin.  There was neither fire nor
candle; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died in the dark--in the dark!  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) couldn't even see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
children's faces, though we heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gasping out their names. I begged
for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they
starved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to death.  I swear it before the God that saw it! They
starved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!'   (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) twined his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hair; and, with a loud
scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes fixed, and the foam
covering his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lips.

<p/>The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had
hitherto remained as quiet as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been wholly deaf to all that
passed, menaced them into silence.  Having unloosened the cravat of the
man who still remained extended on the ground, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tottered towards the
undertaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was my daughter,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head in the
direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more
ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. <div class="bookquote">`Lord, Lord!
Well, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and was a woman
then, should be alive and merry now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lying there: so cold and
stiff!  Lord, Lord!--to think of it; it's as good as a play--as good as
a play!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div><p/>As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hideous merriment,
the undertaker turned to go away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stop, stop!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman in a loud whisper.  <div class="bookquote">`Will she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be
buried to-morrow, or next day, or to-night?  I laid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out; and I must
walk, you know.  Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is
bitter cold.  We should have cake and wine, too, before we go!  Never
mind; send some bread--only a loaf of bread and a cup of water.  Shall
we have some bread, dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said eagerly: catching at the
undertaker's coat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) once more moved towards the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker,`of course.  Anything you like!' He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>)
disengaged himself from the old woman's grasp; and, drawing Oliver
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), hurried away.

<p/>The next day, -LRB-the family having been meanwhile relieved with a
half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble
himself,-RRB- Oliver and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master returned to the miserable abode; where
Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the
workhouse, who were to act as bearers.  An old black cloak had been
thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin
having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers,
and carried into the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>whispered
Sowerberry in the old woman's ear; <div class="bookquote">`we are rather late; and it won't
do, to keep the clergyman waiting.  Move on, my men,--as quick as you
like!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the
two mourners kept as near them, as they could.  Mr. Bumble and
Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs
were not so long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master's, ran by the side.

<p/>There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had
anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the
churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were
made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by
the vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it
might be an hour or so, before he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) came.  So, they put the bier on the
brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp
clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the
spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at
hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by
jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin.  Mr. Sowerberry and
Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>),
and read the paper.

<p/>At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble,
and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.
Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) surplice
as he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) came along.  Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up
appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the
burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
surplice to the clerk, and walked away again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. <div class="bookquote">`Fill up!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the
uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface.  The
grave-digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>)
feet: shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who
murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come, my good fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. <div class="bookquote">`They
want to shut up the yard.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man who had never once moved, since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) station by the
grave side, started, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, stared at the person who had
addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a
swoon.  The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cloak -LRB-which the undertaker had taken off-RRB-, to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) any
attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>); and when he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) came
to, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed
on their different ways.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Sowerberry, as they walked home, <div class="bookquote">`how do you like
it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Pretty well, thank you, sir'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, with considerable
hesitation.  <div class="bookquote">`Not very much, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, you'll get used to it in time, Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">`Nothing
when you _are_ used to it, my boy.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver wondered, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own mind, whether it had taken a very long time
to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) thought it better not to ask
the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) had
seen and heard.



<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND
RATHER ASTONISHES HIM

<p/>The month's trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed.  It was a nice
sickly season just at this time.  In commercial phrase, coffins were
looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great
deal of experience.  The success of Mr. Sowerberry's ingenious
speculation, exceeded even his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) most sanguine hopes.  The oldest
inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so
prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful
processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the
mothers in the town.  As Oliver accompanied his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master in most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
adult expeditions too, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might acquire that equanimity
of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a
finished undertaker, he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had many opportunities of observing the
beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded
people bear their trials and losses.

<p/>For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich
old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews
and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous
illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most
public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need
be--quite cheerful and contented--conversing together with as much
freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb
them.  Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic
calmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far
from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to
render it as becoming and attractive as possible.  It was observable,
too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during
the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached
home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over.  All
this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with
great admiration.

<p/>That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good
people, I cannot, although I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) biographer, undertake to affirm
with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for
many months he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) continued meekly to submit to the domination and
ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) far worse than before, now
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the
black stick and hatband, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>), the old one, remained stationary in
the muffin-cap and leathers.  Charlotte treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) ill, because Noah
did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry
was disposed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) friend; so, between these three on one side, and
a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as
comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was shut up, by mistake, in
the grain department of a brewery.

<p/>And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver's history; for I
have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance,
but which indirectly produced a material change in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) future
prospects and proceedings.

<p/>One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual
dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton--a pound and a
half of the worst end of the neck--when Charlotte being called out of
the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole,
being hungry and vicious, considered he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) could not possibly devote to a
worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.

<p/>Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) feet on the
table-cloth; and pulled Oliver's hair; and twitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ears; and
expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">`sneak' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and furthermore announced
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) intention of coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hanged, whenever that desirable
event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty
annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was.
But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want
to be funny.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) got rather personal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Work`us,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, <div class="bookquote">`how's your mother?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s dead,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver; <div class="bookquote">`don't you say anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to me!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver's colour rose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) breathed quickly; and there
was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole
thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.
Under this impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) returned to the charge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) die of, Work`us?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver:
more as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) were talking to himself, than answering Noah. <div class="bookquote">`I think I
know what it must be to die of that!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work`us,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, as a tear
rolled down Oliver's cheek.  <div class="bookquote">`What's set you a snivelling now?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not _you_,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, sharply. <div class="bookquote">`There; that's enough. Don't say
anything more to me about her (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>); you'd better not!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Better not!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Noah. `Well!  Better not!  Work`us, don't be
impudent.  _Your_ mother, too!  She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a nice <div class="bookquote">`un she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was.  Oh, Lor!'
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And here, Noah nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) head expressively; and curled up as much of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the
occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yer know, Work`us,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver's silence,
and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most
annoying: `Yer know, Work`us, it can't be helped now; and of course yer
couldn't help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I'm sure we all
are, and pity yer very much.  But yer must know, Work`us, yer mother
was a regular right-down bad <div class="bookquote">`un.'

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What did you say?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.

<p/>`A regular right-down bad <div class="bookquote">`un, Work`us,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah, coolly. <div class="bookquote">`And
it's a great deal better, Work`us, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did, or else
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung;
which is more likely than either, isn't it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table;
seized Noah by the throat; shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>), in the violence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) rage, till
his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) teeth chattered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) head; and collecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) whole force into
one heavy blow, felled him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) to the ground.

<p/>A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected
creature that harsh treatment had made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).  But his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spirit was roused
at last; the cruel insult to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dead mother had set his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blood on fire.
His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breast heaved; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) attitude was erect; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eye bright and vivid;
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whole person changed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood glaring over the cowardly
tormentor who now lay crouching at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet; and defied him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with an
energy he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had never known before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll murder me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>blubbered Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`Charlotte!  missis!  Here's the
new boy a murdering of me!  Help! help!  Oliver's gone mad!
Char--lotte!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/>Noah's shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a
louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen
by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) was
quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human
life, to come further down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, you little wretch!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man
in particularly good training.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh, you little un-grate-ful,
mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!'   (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>And between every syllable, Charlotte
gave Oliver a blow with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might: accompanying it with a scream,
for the benefit of society.

<p/>Charlotte's fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not
be effectual in calming Oliver's wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into
the kitchen, and assisted to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) with one hand, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>)
scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face with the other. In this favourable position of
affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) behind.

<p/>This was rather too violent exercise to last long.  When they were all
wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver,
struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and
there locked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) up.  This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a
chair, and burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>)'s going off!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.  <div class="bookquote">`A glass of water, Noah,
dear.  Make haste!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh!  Charlotte,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry:  speaking as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) could,
through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which
Noah had poured over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) head and shoulders.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh! Charlotte, what a
mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah! mercy indeed, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was the reply.  I only hope this'll teach
master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born
to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah!  He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) was
all but killed, ma'am, when I come in.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Poor fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the
charity-boy.

<p/>Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level
with the crown of Oliver's head, rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes with the inside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and performed
some affecting tears and sniffs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's to be done!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.  <div class="bookquote">`Your master's not at
home; there's not a man in the house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll kick that door down in
ten minutes.'   (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Oliver's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in
question, rendered this occurance highly probable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Dear, dear!  I don't know, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">`unless we send for
the police-officers.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Or the millingtary,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Claypole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver's old
friend.  <div class="bookquote">`Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) to come here directly,
and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap!  Make haste!  You can
hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along. It'll keep the
swelling down.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/>Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) fullest speed;
and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a
charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)
head, and a clasp-knife at his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) eye.



<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY

<p/>Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) swiftest pace, and paused
not once for breath, until he (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested
here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an
imposing show of tears and terror, he (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) knocked loudly at the wicket; and
presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that
even he (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>), who saw nothing but rueful faces about him (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) at the best of
times, started back in astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, what's the matter with the boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>the pauper</b></font>)</div>said the old pauper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mr. Bumble!  Mr. Bumble!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and
in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr.
Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) so much
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) rushed into the yard without his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat,--which is a very
curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle,
acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a
momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of
personal dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah:  <div class="bookquote">`Oliver, sir,--Oliver has--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What?  What?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
metallic eyes. <div class="bookquote">`Not run away; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hasn't run away, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), Noah?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, sir, no.  Not run away, sir, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)'s turned wicious,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied
Noah. <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) tried to murder me, sir; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) tried to murder
Charlotte; and then missis.  Oh! what dreadful pain it is!

<p/>Such agony, please, sir!'   (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>And here, Noah writhed and twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) body
into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr.
Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of
Oliver Twist, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.

<p/>When Noah saw that the intelligence he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) communicated perfectly paralysed
Mr. Bumble, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)
dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) observed a
gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) was more tragic in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to
attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman
aforesaid.

<p/>The gentleman's notice was very soon attracted; for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had not walked
three paces, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned angrily round, and inquired what that young
cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) with
something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so
designated, an involuntary process?

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's a poor boy from the free-school, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`who
has been nearly murdered--all but murdered, sir,--by young Twist.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`By Jove!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping
short.  <div class="bookquote">`I knew it!  I felt a strange presentiment from the very first,
that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) missis,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Claypole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) master, too, I think you said, Noah?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)'s out, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) would have murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah. <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) wanted to.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!  Said he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) wanted to, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>), my boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>inquired the gentleman in the
white waistcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`And please, sir, missis wants to know
whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)--'cause master's out.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Certainly, my boy; certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white
waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah's head, which was about
three inches higher than his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) own.  <div class="bookquote">`You're a good boy--a very good boy.
Here's a penny for you.  Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry's with your
cane, and see what's best to be done. Don't spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>), Bumble.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, I will not, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle.  And the cocked hat and cane
having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner's satisfaction, Mr.
Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the
undertaker's shop.

<p/>Here the position of affairs had not at all improved.  Sowerberry had
not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished
vigour, at the cellar-door.  The accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ferocity as related by
Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr.
Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door.  With this
view he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then,
applying his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oliver!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Come; you let me out!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, from the inside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you know this here voice, Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ain't you afraid of it, sir?  Ain't you a-trembling while I speak,
sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, boldly.

<p/>An answer so different from the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had expected to elicit, and was
in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) full height; and
looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute
astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) must be mad,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No boy in half his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) senses could venture to speak so to you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's not Madness, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of
deep meditation.  <div class="bookquote">`It's Meat.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Meat, ma'am, meat,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. <div class="bookquote">`You've
over-fed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), ma'am.  You've raised a artificial soul and spirit in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), ma'am unbecoming a person of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) condition: as the board, Mrs.
Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you.  What have
paupers to do with soul or spirit?  It's quite enough that we let 'em
have live bodies.  If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma'am, this would
never have happened.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Dear, dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) eyes to
the kitchen ceiling: <div class="bookquote">`this comes of being liberal!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/>The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse
bestowal upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else
would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble's heavy accusation.  Of
which, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) justice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or
deed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes down to earth
again; <div class="bookquote">`the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) in the cellar for a day or so, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)'s a little starved
down; and then to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) out, and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) on gruel all through the
apprenticeship.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs.
Sowerberry!  Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed
any well-disposed woman, weeks before.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>At this point of Mr. Bumble's discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to
know that some allusion was being made to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mother, recommenced
kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.
Sowerberry returned at this juncture.  Oliver's offence having been
explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>), with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best
calculated to rouse his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) ire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) unlocked the cellar-door in a
twinkling, and dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.

<p/>Oliver's clothes had been torn in the beating he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had received; his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face
was bruised and scratched; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hair scattered over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forehead.
The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was pulled
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) prison, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite
undismayed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Sowerberry; giving
Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) called my mother names,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, and what if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did, you little ungrateful wretch?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Sowerberry.  <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) deserved what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said, and worse.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) didn't'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) did,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's a lie!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver.

<p/>Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.

<p/>This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) had
hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be
quite clear to every experienced reader that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would have been,
according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a
brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of
a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital
within the limits of this chapter.  To do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) justice, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, as far
as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power went--it was not very extensive--kindly disposed towards
the boy; perhaps, because it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interest to be so; perhaps,
because his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The flood of tears, however, left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no
resource; so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.
Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble's subsequent application of
the parochial cane, rather unnecessary.  For the rest of the day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of
bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks
outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of
Noah and Charlotte, ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) upstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) dismal bed.

<p/>It was not until he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) was left alone in the silence and stillness of the
gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings
which the day's treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a
mere child.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had borne the lash without a cry: for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt that pride swelling in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they
had roasted him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) alive.  But now, when there were none to see or hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knees on the floor; and, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few
so young may ever have cause to pour out before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!

<p/>For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The
candle was burning low in the socket when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feet. Having
gazed cautiously round him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and listened intently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) gently undid the
fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.

<p/>It was a cold, dark night.  The stars seemed, to the boy's eyes,
farther from the earth than he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had ever seen them before; there was no
wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground,
looked sepulchral and death-like, from being so still. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) softly
reclosed the door.  Having availed himself of the expiring light of the
candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.

<p/>With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the
shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door.  One timid look
around--one moment's pause of hesitation--he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had closed it behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>),
and was in the open street.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up
the hill.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across
the fields: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew, after some distance, led out again into the
road; struck into it, and walked quickly on.

<p/>Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had trotted beside
Mr. Bumble, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) first carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to the workhouse from the farm.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) way lay directly in front of the cottage. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heart beat quickly
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bethought himself of this; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) half resolved to turn back.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by
doing so.  Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) being seen; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) walked on.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) reached the house.  There was no appearance of its inmates stirring
at that early hour.  Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden.  A
child was weeding one of the little beds; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
pale face and disclosed the features of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) former companions.
Oliver felt glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went; for, though younger than
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) little friend and playmate.  They had been
beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush, Dick!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
thin arm between the rails to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`Is any one up?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nobody but me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>replied the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You musn't say you saw me, Dick,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`I am running away.
They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some
long way off.  I don't know where.  How pale you are!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>replied the child with a
faint smile.  <div class="bookquote">`I am very glad to see you, dear; but don't stop, don't
stop!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b`ye to you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`I shall
see you again, Dick.  I know I shall!  You will be well and happy!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope so,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>replied the child.  <div class="bookquote">`After I am dead, but not before.  I
know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of
Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.
Kiss me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child,  climbing up the low gate, and flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
little arms round Oliver's neck. <div class="bookquote">`Good-b`ye, dear!  God bless you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>The blessing was from a young child's lips, but it was the first that
Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head; and through the struggles
and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) after life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) never
once forgot it.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON.  HE (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF
YOUNG GENTLEMAN

<p/>Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more
gained the high-road.  It was eight o'clock now. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was nearly
five miles away from the town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ran, and hid behind the hedges, by
turns, till noon: fearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might be pursued and overtaken.  Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think,
for the first time, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had better go and try to live.

<p/>The stone by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was seated, bore, in large characters, an
intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The
name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy's mind.

<p/>London!--that great place!--nobody--not even Mr. Bumble--could ever
find him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) there!  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too,
say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways
of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in
country parts had no idea of.  It was the very place for a homeless
boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). As these
things passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) jumped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet, and again
walked forward.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four
miles more, before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) recollected how much he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must undergo ere he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could
hope to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) place of destination. As this consideration forced
itself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) slackened his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pace a little, and meditated upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
means of getting there.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and
two pairs of stockings, in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bundle.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a penny too--a gift of
Sowerberry's after some funeral in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) had acquitted himself more
than ordinarily well--in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">`A clean shirt,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought Oliver,
<div class="bookquote">`is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings;
and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>walk
in winter time.'  But Oliver's thoughts, like those of most other
people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of
surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular
purpose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) little bundle over to the other shoulder, and
trudged on.

<p/>Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing
but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side.  When the night came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined
to lie there, till morning.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt frightened at first, for the wind
moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was cold and hungry, and
more alone than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever felt before.  Being very tired with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
walk, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) soon fell asleep and forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) troubles.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt cold and stiff, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) got up next morning, and so hungry that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very
first village through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) passed.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had walked no more than
twelve miles, when night closed in again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feet were sore, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
legs so weak that they trembled beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  Another night passed in
the bleak damp air, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) worse; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) set forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) journey
next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could hardly crawl along.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and
then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took
any notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>): and even those told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to wait till they got to the
top of the hill, and then let them see how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could run for a
halfpenny.  Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way,
but was unable to do it, by reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fatigue and sore feet.  When
the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets
again, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was an idle young dog, and didn't deserve
anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust
behind.

<p/>In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all
persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to
jail.  This frightened Oliver very much, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) glad to get out
of those villages with all possible expedition.  In others, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would
stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed:
a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady's ordering one
of the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out
of the place, for she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had come to steal something.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
begged at a farmer's house, ten to one but they threatened to set the
dog on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); and when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nose in a shop, they talked about
the beadle--which brought Oliver's heart into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mouth,--very often
the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had there, for many hours together.

<p/>In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a
benevolent old lady, Oliver's troubles would have been shortened by the
very same process which had put an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother's; in other words,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king's highway.  But
the turnpike-man gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady,
who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part
of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) what little
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could afford--and more--with such kind and gentle words, and such
tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver's
soul, than all the sufferings he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever undergone.

<p/>Early on the seventh morning after he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) native place, Oliver
limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were
closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business
of the day.  The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the
light only served to show the boy his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own lonesomeness and desolation,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.

<p/>By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up;
and people began passing to and fro.  Some few stopped to gaze at
Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) as they
hurried by; but none relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), or troubled themselves to inquire
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) came there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had no heart to beg. And there he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sat.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great
number of public-houses -LRB-every other house in Barnet was a tavern,
large or small-RRB-, gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed
through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with
ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a whole week of courage and
determination beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) years to accomplish: when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was roused by
observing that a boy, who had passed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) carelessly some minutes
before, had returned, and was now surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) most earnestly from the
opposite side of the way.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took little heed of this at first; but
the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long,
that Oliver raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, and returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) steady look.  Upon this,
the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hullo, my covey!  What's the row?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even
seen.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and
as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) all
the airs and manners of a man.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was short of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) age: with rather
bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes.  His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hat was stuck on the top
of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every
moment--and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a
knack of every now and then giving his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head a sudden twitch, which
brought it back to its old place again.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wore a man's coat, which
reached nearly to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heels.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had turned the cuffs back, half-way up
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm, to get his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the
ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) corduroy
trousers; for there he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kept them.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was, altogether, as roystering
and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or
something less, in the bluchers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hullo, my covey!  What's the row?'  (<font color='red'><b>this gentleman</b></font>)</div>said this strange young gentleman
to Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I am very hungry and tired,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver: the tears standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">`I have walked a long way.  I have been walking these
seven days.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Walking for sivin days!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the young gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh, I see. Beak's
order, eh?  But,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added, noticing Oliver's look of surprise, <div class="bookquote">`I
suppose you don't know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver mildly replied, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had always heard a bird's mouth
described by the term in question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`My eyes, how green!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the young gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`Why, a beak's a
madgst`rate; and when you walk by a beak's order, it's not straight
forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin.  Was you
never on the mill?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What mill?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What mill!  Why, _the_ mill--the mill as takes up so little room that
it'll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind's
low with people, than when it's high; acos then they can't get workmen.
But come,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the young gentleman; `you want grub, and you shall have
it.  I'm at low-water-mark myself--only one bob and a magpie; but, as
far as it goes, I'll fork out and stump.  Up with you on your pins.
There!  Now then! <div class="bookquote">`Morrice!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to an adjacent
chandler's shop, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham
and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) himself expressed it, <div class="bookquote">`a fourpenny
bran!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the
ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a
portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein.  Taking the bread under
his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led
the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer
was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver,
falling to, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) new friend's bidding, made a long and hearty meal,
during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from time to time
with great attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Going to London?'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length
concluded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Got any lodgings?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Money?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The strange boy whistled; and put his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pockets, as far as
the big coat-sleeves would let them go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you live in London?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes. I do, when I'm at home,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>replied the boy. <div class="bookquote">`I suppose you want
some place to sleep in to-night, don't you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I do, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>answered Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`I have not slept under a roof since I
left the country.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't fret your eyelids on that score,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the young gentleman.
`I've got to be in London to-night; and I know a <div class="bookquote">`spectable old
gentleman as lives there, wot'll give you lodgings for nothink, and
never ask for the change--that is, if any genelman he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows interduces
you. And don't he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) know me?  Oh, no! Not in the least!  By no means.
Certainly not!'

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments
of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did
so.

<p/>This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted;
especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the
old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a
comfortable place, without loss of time.  This led to a more friendly
and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
friend's name was Jack Dawkins, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was a peculiar pet and
protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.

<p/>Mr. Dawkin's appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the
comforts which his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) patron's interest obtained for those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) took
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) protection; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had a rather flightly and dissolute
mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) intimate
friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was better known by the sobriquet of <div class="bookquote">`The Artful Dodger,'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the
moral precepts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  Under this impression, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) secretly resolved to cultivate the good
opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found
the Dodger incorrigible, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) more than half suspected he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should, to
decline the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) farther acquaintance.

<p/>As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it
was nearly eleven o'clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington.
They crossed from the Angel into St. John's Road; struck down the small
street which terminates at Sadler's Wells Theatre; through Exmouth
Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the
workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of
Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into
Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace,
directing Oliver to follow close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heels.

<p/>Although Oliver had enough to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) attention in keeping sight of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) leader, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either
side of the way, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) passed along.  A dirtier or more wretched place
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had never seen.  The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air
was impregnated with filthy odours.

<p/>There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade
appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were
crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside.  The
sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the
place, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish
were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here
and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of
houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth;
and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were
cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed
or harmless errands.

<p/>Oliver was just considering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hadn't better run away, when
they reached the bottom of the hill.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) conductor, catching him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) by
the arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) into the passage, closed it behind them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, then!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the
Dodger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Plummy and slam!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply.

<p/>This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the
light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the
passage; and a man's face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the
old kitchen staircase had been broken away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There's two on you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, thrusting the candle farther out,
and shielding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.  <div class="bookquote">`Who's the t`other one?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A new pal,'  (<font color='red'><b>Jack Dawkins/Jack</b></font>)</div>replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) come from?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Greenland. Is Fagin upstairs?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s a sortin'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the wipes.  Up with you!'  The candle was drawn
back, and the face disappeared.

<p/>Oliver, groping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) way with one hand, and having the other firmly
grasped by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and
broken stairs: which his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) conductor mounted with an ease and expedition
that showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was well acquainted with them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/>The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and
dirt.  There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a
candle, stuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf
and butter, and a plate.  In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and
which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were
cooking; and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand, was
a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face
was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was dressed in a
greasy flannel gown, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) throat bare; and seemed to be dividing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which
a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging.  Several rough beds
made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round
the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking
long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men.
These all crowded about their associate as he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) whispered a few words to
the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver.  So did the Jew
himself, toasting-fork in hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Jack Dawkins/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Jack Dawkins;`my friend Oliver Twist.'

<p/>The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) by the
hand, and hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should have the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) intimate acquaintance.
Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and shook
both his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands very hard--especially the one in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
little bundle.  One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cap
for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); and another was so obliging as to put his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
pockets, in order that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very tired, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might not have the
trouble of emptying them, himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went to bed.  These
civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal
exercise of the Jew's toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the
affectionate youths who offered them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. <div class="bookquote">`Dodger,
take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver.  Ah,
you're a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear. There are a
good many of 'em, ain't there? We've just looked 'em out, ready for the
wash; that's all, Oliver; that's all. Ha! ha! ha!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the pupils</b></font>)</div><p/>The latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from
all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of
which they went to supper.

<p/>Oliver ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) share, and the Jew then mixed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a glass of hot
gin-and-water: telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) must drink it off directly, because
another gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was desired.
Immediately afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt himself gently lifted on to one of the
sacks; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sunk into a deep sleep.



<p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN,
AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>GENTLEMAN</b></font>) HOPEFUL PUPILS

<p/>It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.
There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling
some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to
himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) would
stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below:
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had satisfied himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) would go on whistling and
stirring again, as before.

<p/>Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was not thoroughly
awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you
dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half
conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in
five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in
perfect unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal knows just enough of
what his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its
mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space,
when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.

<p/>Oliver was precisely in this condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) saw the Jew with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
half-closed eyes; heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) low whistling; and recognised the sound of
the spoon grating against the saucepan's sides: and yet the self-same
senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with
almost everybody he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever known.

<p/>When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.
Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
did not well know how to employ himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) turned round and looked at
Oliver, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) name. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did not answer, and was to all
appearances asleep.

<p/>After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the
door: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) fastened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver,
from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) placed carefully on
the table. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes glistened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) raised the lid, and looked in.
Dragging an old chair to the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sat down; and took from it a
magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Aha!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, shrugging up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) shoulders, and distorting every
feature with a hideous grin. <div class="bookquote">`Clever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the
last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old
Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn't have loosened the knot, or kept
the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew
once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a
dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed
with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other
articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly
workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.

<p/>Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that
it lay in the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hand. There seemed to be some very minute
inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading
it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) put
it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) chair,
muttered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead
men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it's a fine thing for the
trade! Five of 'em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or
turn white-livered!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As the Jew uttered these words, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) bright dark eyes, which had been
staring vacantly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), fell on Oliver's face; the boy's eyes were
fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only
for an instant--for the briefest space of time that can possibly be
conceived--it was enough to show the old man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been observed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on
a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trembled
very much though; for, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) terror, Oliver could see that the
knife quivered in the air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. `What do you watch me for? Why are you
awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick--quick! for your life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, meekly. <div class="bookquote">`I am
very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You were not awake an hour ago?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, scowling fiercely on
the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No! No, indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Are you sure?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before:
and a threatening attitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Upon my word I was not, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">`I was not,
indeed, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Tush, tush, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, abruptly resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) old manner,
and playing with the knife a little, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) laid it down; as if to
induce the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had caught it up, in mere sport. <div class="bookquote">`Of course I
know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You're a brave boy.
Ha! ha! you're a brave boy, Oliver.'  (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div>The Jew rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands with a
chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, laying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hand upon it after a short pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning rather pale. <div class="bookquote">`They--they're mine, Oliver;
my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks
call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that's all.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in
such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a good deal of
money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
might get up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Certainly, my dear, certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`Stay.
There's a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here;
and I'll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to
raise the pitcher.  When he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, the box was gone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying
the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew's directions, when
the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom
Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally
introduced to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on
the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought
home in the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself
to the Dodger, <div class="bookquote">`I hope you've been at work this morning, my dears?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hard,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`As nails,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>added Charley Bates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Good boys, good boys!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. <div class="bookquote">`What have you got, Dodger?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A couple of pocket-books,'  (<font color='red'><b>gentlman</b></font>)</div>replied that young gentlman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Lined?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew, with eagerness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Pretty well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one
green, and the other red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not so heavy as they might be,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, after looking at the
insides carefully; <div class="bookquote">`but very neat and nicely made.  Ingenious workman,
ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>), Oliver?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Very indeed, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed
uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to
laugh at, in anything that had passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And what have you got, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin to Charley Bates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Wipes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four
pocket-handkerchiefs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, inspecting them closely; <div class="bookquote">`they're very good ones,
very. You haven't marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall
be picked out with a needle, and we'll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall
us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If you please, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You'd like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley
Bates, wouldn't you, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Very much, indeed, if you'll teach me, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/>Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was
drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly
terminated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) premature suffocation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is so jolly green!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) recovered, as an apology
to the company for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) unpolite behaviour.

<p/>The Dodger said nothing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) smoothed Oliver's hair over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes,
and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman,
observing Oliver's colour mounting, changed the subject by asking
whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?
This made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies
of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally
wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very
industrious.

<p/>When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two
boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in
this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) waistcoat
pocket, with a guard-chain round his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) neck, and sticking a mock diamond
pin in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shirt: buttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) coat tight round him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
spectacle-case and handkerchief in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pockets, trotted up and down the
room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen
walk about the streets any hour in the day.  Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stopped at
the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
staring with all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might into shop-windows.  At such times, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would
look constantly round him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping
all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pockets in turn, to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hadn't lost anything, in such a
very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face.  All this time, the two boys followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) closely about:
getting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sight, so nimbly, every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) turned round, that
it was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) toes, or ran upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) boot accidently, while Charley Bates
stumbled up against him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) behind; and in that one moment they took from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case,
watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the
spectacle-case.  If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
pockets, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) cried out where it was; and then the game began all over
again.

<p/>When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young
ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet,
and the other Nancy.  They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly
turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings.
They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of
colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty.  Being
remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them
very nice girls indeed.  As there is no doubt they were.

<p/>The visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence
of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) inside; and
the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length,
Charley Bates expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) opinion that it was time to pad the hoof.
This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly
afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went
away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with
money to spend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin. <div class="bookquote">`That's a pleasant life, isn't it? They
have gone out for the day.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Have they done work, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`that is, unless they should unexpectedly come
across any, when they are out; and they won't neglect it, if they do,
my dear, depend upon it.  Make 'em your models, my dear. Make 'em your
models,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
words; <div class="bookquote">`do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all
matters--especially the Dodger's, my dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)'ll be a great man
himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>).--Is my
handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, stopping
short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do,
when we were at play this morning.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had seen
the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with
the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is it gone?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Here it is, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, showing it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You're a clever boy, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the playful old gentleman, patting
Oliver on the head approvingly. <div class="bookquote">`I never saw a sharper lad. Here's a
shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you'll be the greatest man
of the time. And now come here, and I'll show you how to take the marks
out of the handkerchiefs.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman's pocket in play, had to
do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) chances of being a great man.  But, thinking that the Jew,
being so much his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) senior, must know best, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) quietly to
the table, and was soon deeply involved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) new study.



<p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) NEW
ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT,
BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY

<p/>For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew's room, picking the marks out
of the pocket-handkerchief, -LRB-of which a great number were brought
home,-RRB- and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which
the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of
earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to go out to work
with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) two companions.

<p/>Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman's character.
Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy
habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by
sending them supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) even went
so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was
carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.

<p/>At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had so
eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two
or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these
were reasons for the old gentleman's giving his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) assent; but, whether
they were or no, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told Oliver he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might go, and placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) under the
joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) friend the Dodger.

<p/>The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) coat-sleeves tucked up,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they
were going, and what branch of manufacture he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would be instructed in,
first.

<p/>The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter,
that Oliver soon began to think his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) companions were going to deceive
the old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a
vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small
boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some
very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering
divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and
thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that
they seemed to undermine his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) whole suit of clothes in every direction.
These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) intention of seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) way back, in the best way he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could; when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very
mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.

<p/>They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open
square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion
of terms, <div class="bookquote">`The Green' (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) lip, drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) companions back again, with the
greatest caution and circumspection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>demanded Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">`Do you see that old cove at the
book-stall?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The old gentleman over the way?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`Yes, I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll do,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Doger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A prime plant,'  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>observed Master Charley Bates.

<p/>Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked
stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman
towards whom his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces
after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood
looking on in silent amazement.

<p/>The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a
powdered head and gold spectacles. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was dressed in a bottle-green
coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a
smart bamboo cane under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had taken up a book from the stall,
and there he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stood, reading away, as hard as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) were in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
elbow-chair, in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own study. It is very possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fancied
himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) abstraction, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short,
anything but the book itself: which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was reading straight through:
turning over the leaf when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got to the bottom of a page, beginning at
the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest
interest and eagerness.

<p/>What was Oliver's horror and alarm as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stood a few paces off, looking
on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the
Dodger plunge his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hand into the old gentleman's pocket, and draw from
thence a handkerchief! To see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hand the same to Charley Bates; and
finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full
speed!

<p/>In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches,
and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy's mind.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
veins from terror, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were in a burning fire; then,
confused and frightened, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heels; and, not knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
did, made off as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could lay his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet to the ground.

<p/>This was all done in a minute's space. In the very instant when Oliver
began to run, the old gentleman, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pocket, and
missing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding
away at such a rapid pace, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) very naturally concluded him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to be the
depredator; and shouting <div class="bookquote">`Stop thief!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might, made off
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), book in hand.

<p/>But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the
hue-and-cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public
attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the
very first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and
saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they
issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting <div class="bookquote">`Stop thief!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>too,
joined in the pursuit like good citizens.

<p/>Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was not
theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that
self-preservation is the first law of nature. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been, perhaps
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it
alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) the more; so away he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went like the wind, with the old
gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stop thief! Stop thief!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman
leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) counter, and the car-man his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) waggon; the butcher throws down
his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) tray; the baker his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) basket; the milkman his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) pail; the errand-boy
his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) parcels; the school-boy his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) marbles; the paviour his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) pickaxe; the
child his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter,
slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as
they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls:
and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stop thief! Stop thief!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and
the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through
the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run
the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the
very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the
shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, <div class="bookquote">`Stop thief! Stop thief!'

 (<font color='red'><b>audience</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Stop thief! Stop thief!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There is a passion FOR _hunting_ _something_
deeply implanted in the human breast.  One wretched breathless child,
panting with exhaustion; terror in his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) looks; agony in his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) eyes; large
drops of perspiration streaming down his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) face; strains every nerve to
make head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) pursuers; and as they follow on his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) track, and gain
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) every instant, they hail his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) decreasing strength with joy.
<div class="bookquote">`Stop thief!'   (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Ay, stop him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) for God's sake, were it only in mercy!

<p/>Stopped at last!  A clever blow.  He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) is down upon the pavement; and the
crowd eagerly gather round him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>):  each new comer, jostling and
struggling with the others to catch a glimpse.  <div class="bookquote">`Stand aside!'   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Give
him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) a little air!'   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Nonsense! he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) don't deserve it.'   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Where's the
gentleman?'   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Here his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is, coming down the street.'   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Make room there
for the gentleman!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Is this the boy, sir!'   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Yes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth,
looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), when
the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by
the foremost of the pursuers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`I am afraid it is the boy.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Afraid!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>murmured the crowd.  `That's a good <div class="bookquote">`un!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Poor fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has hurt himself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`_I_ did that, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward;
<div class="bookquote">`and preciously I cut my knuckle agin'  (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mouth.  I stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), sir.'

<p/>The follow touched his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hat with a grin, expecting something for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with an expression of
dislike, look anxiously round, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) contemplated running away
himself:  which it is very possible he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might have attempted to do, and
thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer -LRB-who is
generally the last person to arrive in such cases-RRB- at that moment made
his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come, get up,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, roughly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It wasn't me indeed, sir.  Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands passionately, and looking round.  <div class="bookquote">`They
are here somewhere.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh no, they ain't,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said the officer.  He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) meant this to be ironical,
but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off
down the first convenient court they came to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come, get up!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, compassionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh no, I won't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>replied the officer, tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) jacket half
off his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) back, in proof thereof.  <div class="bookquote">`Come, I know you; it won't do.  Will
you stand upon your legs, you young devil?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at
a rapid pace.  The gentleman walked on with them by the officer's side;
and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead,
and stared back at Oliver from time to time.  The boys shouted in
triumph; and on they went.



<p/>CHAPTER XI

<p/>TREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT
SPECIMEN OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE

<p/>The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the
immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office.
The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two
or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was led
beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of
summary justice, by the back way.  It was a small paved yard into which
they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of
whiskers on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and a bunch of keys in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the matter now?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man carelessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A young fogle-hunter,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man who had Oliver in charge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Are you the party that's been robbed, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>inquired the man with the
keys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the old gentleman; <div class="bookquote">`but I am not sure that this
boy actually took the handkerchief.  I--I would rather not press the
case.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Must go before the magistrate now, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man. <div class="bookquote">`His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worship
will be disengaged in half a minute.  Now, young gallows!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
unlocked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke, and which led into a stone cell.  Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was
searched; and nothing being found upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), locked up.

<p/>This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not
so light.  It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning;
and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up,
elsewhere, since Saturday night.  But this is little.  In our
station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most
trivial charges--the word is worth noting--in dungeons, compared with
which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried,
found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. Let any one who
doubts this, compare the two.

<p/>The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated
in the lock.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the
innocent cause of all this disturbance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There is something in that boy's face,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman to
himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) walked slowly away, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chin with the cover of
the book, in a thoughtful manner; <div class="bookquote">`something that touches and interests
me.  _Can_ he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) be innocent?  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked like--Bye the bye,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the
old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky,
<div class="bookquote">`Bless my soul!--where have I seen something like that look before?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same
meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there,
retiring into a corner, called up before his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind's eye a vast
amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many
years.  <div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman imagination</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head; `it must be
imagination.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wandered over them again.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had called them into view, and it was
not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them.  There
were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost
strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of
young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that
the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to
its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling
back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming
of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond
the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be
set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to
Heaven.

<p/>But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver's
features bore a trace.  So, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heaved a sigh over the recollections he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman,
buried them again in the pages of the musty book.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man
with the keys to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the office.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) book
hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the
renowned Mr. Fang.

<p/>The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall.  Mr. Fang sat
behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of
wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling
very much at the awfulness of the scene.

<p/>Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with
no great quantity of hair, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) had, growing on the back and
sides of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) head.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) face was stern, and much flushed.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) were
really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) might have brought action against his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) countenance for
libel, and have recovered heavy damages.

<p/>The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate's
desk, said, suiting the action to the word, <div class="bookquote">`That is my name and
address, sir.'   (<font color='red'><b>the magistrate</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another
polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.

<p/>Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading
article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent
decision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>), and commending him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>), for the three hundred and fiftieth
time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State
for the Home Department.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) was out of temper; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) looked up with
an angry scowl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Who are you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang.

<p/>The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) card.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Officer!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the
newspaper.  <div class="bookquote">`Who is this fellow?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`My name, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman,
<div class="bookquote">`my name, sir, is Brownlow.  Permit me to inquire the name of the
magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a
respectable person, under the protection of the bench.'   (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>Saying this,
Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person
who would afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) the required information.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Officer!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, <div class="bookquote">`what's this
fellow charged with?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>)'s not charged at all, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>replied the officer. <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
appears against this boy, your worship.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and
a safe one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Appears against the boy, does he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr.
Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot.  <div class="bookquote">`Swear him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow;
<div class="bookquote">`and that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could
have believed--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang, peremptorily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I will not, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>replied the old gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue this instant, or I'll have you turned out of the
office!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang.  <div class="bookquote">`You're an insolent impertinent fellow.  How
dare you bully a magistrate!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Swear this person!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Fang to the clerk.  <div class="bookquote">`I'll not hear another
word.  Swear him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brownlow's indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) suppressed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Fang, <div class="bookquote">`what's the charge against this boy?  What have you
got to say, sir?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I was standing at a bookstall--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brownlow began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang.  <div class="bookquote">`Policeman!  Where's the
policeman?  Here, swear this policeman.  Now, policeman, what is this?'

 (<font color='red'><b>The policeman</b></font>)</div><p/>The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had taken the
charge; how he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) person;
and how that was all he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) knew about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Are there any witnesses?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Fang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`None, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>replied the policeman.

<p/>Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the
prosecutor, said in a towering passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or
do you not?  You have been sworn.  Now, if you stand there, refusing to
give evidence, I'll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will,
by--'

 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed
very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy
book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being
heard--accidently, of course.

<p/>With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived
to state his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) case;  observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
had run after the boy because he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) running away; and
expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hope that, if the magistrate should believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>),
although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>)
would deal as leniently with him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) as justice would allow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) has been hurt already,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman in conclusion. <div class="bookquote">`And
I fear,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, <div class="bookquote">`I
really fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is ill.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! yes, I dare say!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang, with a sneer.  <div class="bookquote">`Come, none of
your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won't do. What's your name?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver tried to reply but his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) tongue failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was deadly pale;
and the whole place seemed turning round and round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Fang.
<div class="bookquote">`Officer, what's his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) name?'

 (<font color='red'><b>a bluff fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who
was standing by the bar.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) bent over Oliver, and repeated the
inquiry; but finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) really incapable of understanding the
question; and knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) not replying would only infuriate the
magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sentence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
hazarded a guess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) says his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) name's Tom White, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the kind-hearted
thief-taker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) won't speak out, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Fang.  <div class="bookquote">`Very well, very well.
Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) live?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Where he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) can, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>replied the officer; again pretending to
receive Oliver's answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) any parents?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Fang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) says they died in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) infancy, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>replied the officer:
hazarding the usual reply.

<p/>At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head; and, looking
round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of
water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stuff and nonsense!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang:  <div class="bookquote">`don't try to make a fool of me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) really is ill, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the officer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I know better,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>), officer,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands
instinctively; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'ll fall down.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Stand away, officer,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>cried Fang;  <div class="bookquote">`let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) likes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in
a fainting fit.  The men in the office looked at each other, but no one
dared to stir.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was shamming,'  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>said Fang, as if this were incontestable
proof of the fact.  <div class="bookquote">`Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) lie there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>)'ll soon be tired of that.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?'   (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>inquired the clerk in
a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Summarily,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Fang.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) stands committed for three
months--hard labour of course.  Clear the office.'

 (<font color='red'><b>a couple</b></font>)</div><p/>The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were
preparing to carry the insensible boy to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cell; when an elderly man
of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed
hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stop, stop!  don't take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) away!  For Heaven's sake stop a moment!'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the new comer, breathless with haste.

<p/>Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a
summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the
character, almost the lives, of Her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) Majesty's subjects, expecially of
the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic
tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are
closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily
press.-LSB-Footnote:  Or were virtually, then.-RSB- Mr. Fang was consequently
not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such
irreverent disorder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What is this?  Who is this?  Turn this man out.  Clear the office!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Fang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I _will_ speak,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>cried the man; <div class="bookquote">`I will not be turned out.  I saw it
all.  I keep the book-stall.  I demand to be sworn. I will not be put
down.  Mr. Fang, you must hear me.  You must not refuse, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man was right.  His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner was determined; and the matter was
growing rather too serious to be hushed up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Swear the man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. <div class="bookquote">`Now, man,
what have you got to say?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`This,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man:  <div class="bookquote">`I saw three boys:  two others and the prisoner
here:  loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman
was reading.  The robbery was committed by another boy.  I saw it done;
and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall
keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact
circumstances of the robbery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why didn't you come here before?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Fang, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hadn't a soul to mind the shop,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>replied the man.  <div class="bookquote">`Everybody who
could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit.  I could get nobody
till five minutes ago; and I've run here all the way.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The prosecutor was reading, was he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>inquired Fang, after another
pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man.  <div class="bookquote">`The very book he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, that book, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Fang.  <div class="bookquote">`Is it paid for?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, it is not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Dear me, I forgot all about it!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the absent old gentleman,
innocently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Fang, with
a comical effort to look humane.  <div class="bookquote">`I consider, sir, that you have
obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and
disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate
that the owner of the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a
lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet.  The boy is
discharged.  Clear the office!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><p/>'D--n me!' cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
kept down so long, 'd--n me!   I'll--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Clear the office!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the magistrate.  <div class="bookquote">`Officers, do you hear? Clear
the office!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed
out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other:  in a
perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) reached the yard; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
passion vanished in a moment.  Little Oliver Twist lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) back on
the pavement, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) shirt unbuttoned, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) temples bathed with
water; his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) whole
frame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Poor boy, poor boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`Call a
coach, somebody, pray.  Directly!'

 (<font color='red'><b>A coach</b></font>)</div><p/>A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the
seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`May I accompany you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the book-stall keeper</b></font>)</div>said the book-stall keeper, looking in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bless me, yes, my dear sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow quickly.  <div class="bookquote">`I forgot
you.  Dear, dear!  I have this unhappy book still! Jump in.  Poor
fellow!  There's no time to lose.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.



<p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN
WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>GENTLEMAN</b></font>) YOUTHFUL
FRIENDS.

<p/>The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which
Oliver had traversed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) first entered London in company with the
Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at
Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady
street near Pentonville.  Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of
time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) young charge carefully and
comfortably deposited; and here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was tended with a kindness and
solicitude that knew no bounds.

<p/>But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) new friends.  The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and
many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) uneasy
bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.  The
worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow
creeping fire upon the living frame.

<p/>Weak, and thin, and pallid, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) awoke at last from what seemed to have
been a long and troubled dream.  Feebly raising himself in the bed,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trembling arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked anxiously around.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What room is this?  Where have I been brought to?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`This
is not the place I went to sleep in.'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak;
but they were overheard at once.  The curtain at the bed's head was
hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely
dressed, rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been sitting at needle-work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady softly.  <div class="bookquote">`You must be very quiet, or
you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,--as bad as bad could
be, pretty nigh.  Lie down again; there's a dear!'   (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>With those words,
the old lady very gently placed Oliver's head upon the pillow; and,
smoothing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hair from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forehead, looked so kindly and loving
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not help placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) little withered hand in
hers, and drawing it round his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Save us!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes.  <div class="bookquote">`What a grateful
little dear it is.  Pretty creetur!  What would his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother feel if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had sat by him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) as I have, and could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) now!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does see me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>whispered Oliver, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands
together; <div class="bookquote">`perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has sat by me.  I almost feel as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That was the fever, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady mildly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I suppose it was,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, <div class="bookquote">`because heaven is a long way off;
and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor
boy.  But if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew I was ill, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must have pitied me, even there;
for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very ill herself before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) died.  She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can't know anything
about me though,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>added Oliver after a moment's silence.  <div class="bookquote">`If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
seen me hurt, it would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sorrowful; and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face has always
looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes first, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were
part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver
to drink; and then, patting him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) on the cheek, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) must lie very
quiet, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would be ill again.

<p/>So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was anxious to obey the
kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
was completely exhausted with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had already said.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) soon fell
into a gentle doze, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was awakened by the light of a
candle:  which, being brought near the bed, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a gentleman with
a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand, who felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
pulse, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was a great deal better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the
gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, thank you, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,  I know you are,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman:  <div class="bookquote">`You're hungry too, an't
you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>answered Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hem!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`No, I know you're not.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is not hungry,
Mrs. Bedwin,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman:  looking very wise.

<p/>The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought the doctor was a very clever man. The doctor
appeared much of the same opinion himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You feel sleepy, don't you, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. <div class="bookquote">`You're
not sleepy.  Nor thirsty.  Are you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir, rather thirsty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>answered Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`It's very natural
that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should be thirsty.  You may give him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) a little tea, ma'am, and
some dry toast without any butter.  Don't keep him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) too warm, ma'am; but
be careful that you don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) be too cold; will you have the
goodness?'

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady dropped a curtsey.  The doctor, after tasting the cool
stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away:  his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went
downstairs.

<p/>Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) awoke, it was nearly
twelve o'clock.  The old lady tenderly bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) good-night shortly
afterwards, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in charge of a fat old woman who had just
come:  bringing with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a
large nightcap. Putting the latter on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and the former on the
table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come to sit up
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), drew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chair close to the fire and went off into a series
of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings
forward, and divers moans and chokings. These, however, had no worse
effect than causing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to rub her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nose very hard, and then fall asleep
again.

<p/>And thus the night crept slowly on.  Oliver lay awake for some time,
counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the
rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) languid
eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall. The darkness and
the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into
the boy's mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many
days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
awful presence, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face upon the pillow, and fervently
prayed to Heaven.

<p/>Gradually, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent
suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain
to wake from.  Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all
the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present;
its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of
the past!

<p/>It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt
cheerful and happy.  The crisis of the disease was safely past.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
belonged to the world again.

<p/>In three days' time he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped
up with pillows; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) carried downstairs into the little housekeeper's room, which
belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bedwin</b></font>).  Having him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) set, here, by the fire-side, the good old
lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable
delight at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) so much better, forthwith began to cry most
violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Never mind me, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady; <div class="bookquote">`I'm only having a regular
good cry.  There; it's all over now; and I'm quite comfortable.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You're very, very kind to me, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, never you mind that, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady; <div class="bookquote">`that's got
nothing to do with your broth; and it's full time you had it; for the
doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we
must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)'ll
be pleased.'   (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming
up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth:  strong enough, Oliver
thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation
strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest
computation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Are you fond of pictures, dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>inquired the old lady, seeing that
Oliver had fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung
against the wall; just opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't quite know, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, without taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes from
the canvas; <div class="bookquote">`I have seen so few that I hardly know.  What a beautiful,
mild face that lady's is!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, <div class="bookquote">`painters always make ladies out prettier than
they are, or they wouldn't get any custom, child. The man that invented
the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never
succeed; it's a deal too honest.  A deal,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, laughing
very heartily at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own acuteness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is--is that a likeness, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth;
<div class="bookquote">`that's a portrait.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Whose, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>asked Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, really, my dear, I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>answered the old lady in a
good-humoured manner.  <div class="bookquote">`It's not a likeness of anybody that you or I
know, I expect.  It seems to strike your fancy, dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It is so pretty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, sure you're not afraid of it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady look</b></font>)</div>said the old lady: observing in
great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the
painting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh no, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>returned Oliver quickly; <div class="bookquote">`but the eyes look so sorrowful;
and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me.  It makes my heart beat,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>added Oliver in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">`as if it was alive, and wanted to speak
to me, but couldn't.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Lord save us!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old lady, starting; <div class="bookquote">`don't talk in that
way, child.  You're weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel
your chair round to the other side; and then you won't see it.  There!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; <div class="bookquote">`you don't see it
now, at all events.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver _did_ see it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind's eye as distinctly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had not
altered his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) position; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thought it better not to worry the kind
old lady; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) smiled gently when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and Mrs. Bedwin,
satisfied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of
toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a
preparation. Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at
the door.  <div class="bookquote">`Come in,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.

<p/>Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had no
sooner raised his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) forehead, and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands
behind the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dressing-gown to take a good long look at
Oliver, than his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) countenance underwent a very great variety of odd
contortions.  Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and
made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
benefactor, which terminated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sinking back into the chair again;
and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow's heart,
being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane
disposition, forced a supply of tears into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) eyes, by some hydraulic
process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a
condition to explain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Poor boy, poor boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">`I'm
rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin.  I'm afraid I have caught
cold.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope not, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bedwin.  <div class="bookquote">`Everything you have had, has
been well aired, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know, Bedwin.  I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`I rather
think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind
that.  How do you feel, my dear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Very happy, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`And very grateful indeed, sir, for
your goodness to me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Good by,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly.  <div class="bookquote">`Have you given him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) any
nourishment, Bedwin?  Any slops, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs.
Bedwin:  drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the
last word:  to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded,
there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ugh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; <div class="bookquote">`a couple of glasses
of port wine would have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) a great deal more good. Wouldn't they,
Tom White, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`My name is Oliver, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the little invalid:  with a look of
great astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`Oliver what?  Oliver White, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Queer name!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`What made you tell the
magistrate your name was White?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I never told him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) so, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>returned Oliver in amazement.

<p/>This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked
somewhat sternly in Oliver's face.  It was impossible to doubt him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>);
there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Some mistake,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow.  But, although his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) motive for
looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the
resemblance between his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) features and some familiar face came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
so strongly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) gaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope you are not angry with me, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes
beseechingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the old gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`Why! what's this?  Bedwin, look
there!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver's head, and
then to the boy's face.  There was its living copy. The eyes, the head,
the mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the
instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with
startling accuracy!

<p/>Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being
strong enough to bear the start it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fainted away.  A
weakness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of
relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils
of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording--

<p/>That when the Dodger, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) accomplished friend Master Bates, joined
in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver's heels, in consequence
of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow's personal
property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very
laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the
freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the
first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need
hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt
them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great
a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own
preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code
of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid
down as the main-springs of all Nature's deeds and actions:  the said
philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady's proceedings to
matters of maxim and theory:  and, by a very neat and pretty compliment
to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight
any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling. For,
these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by
universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and
weaknesses of her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) sex.

<p/>If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of
the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate
predicament, I should at once find it in the fact -LRB-also recorded in a
foregoing part of this narrative-RRB-, of their quitting the pursuit, when
the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for
their home by the shortest possible cut.  Although I do not mean to
assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages,
to shorten the road to any great conclusion -LRB-their course indeed being
rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and
discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the
pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge-RRB-; still, I
do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable
practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories,
to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every
possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect
themselves.  Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and
you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the
amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the
distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher
concerned, to be settled and determined by his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) clear, comprehensive,
and impartial view of his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) own particular case.

<p/>It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through
a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured
to halt beneath a low and dark archway.  Having remained silent here,
just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an
exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an
uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and
rolled thereon in a transport of mirth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>inquired the Dodger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>roared Charley Bates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hold your noise,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round.
<div class="bookquote">`Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I can't help it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley, <div class="bookquote">`I can't help it!  To see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and
knocking up again'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>the posts, and starting on again as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was made
of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out
arter him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)--oh, my eye!' The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented
the scene before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) in too strong colours.  As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) arrived at this
apostrophe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than
before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What'll Fagin say?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next
interval of breathlessness on the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) friend to propound the
question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>repeated Charley Bates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, what?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, what should he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) say?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>inquired Charley:  stopping rather suddenly
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) merriment; for the Dodger's manner was impressive.  <div class="bookquote">`What should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) say?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawkins/Mr. John Dawkins/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) hat,
scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) head, and nodded thrice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) wouldn't, and high
cockolorum,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger:  with a slight sneer on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) intellectual
countenance.

<p/>This was explanatory, but not satisfactory.  Master Bates felt it so;
and again said, <div class="bookquote">`What do you mean?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>The Dodger made no reply; but putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hat on again, and gathering
the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) long-tailed coat under his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) arm, thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) tongue
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) cheek, slapped the bridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) nose some half-dozen times in
a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) heel, slunk down
the court.  Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance.

<p/>The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the
occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand; a
pocket-knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right; and a pewter pot on the trivet.  There was a
rascally smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) white face as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned round, and looking
sharply out from under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thick red eyebrows, bent his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ear towards the
door, and listened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, how's this?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>muttered the Jew:  changing countenance; <div class="bookquote">`only two
of 'em?  Where's the third?  They can't have got into trouble.  Hark!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was
slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it
behind them.



<p/>CHAPTER XIII

<p/>SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER,
CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING
TO THIS HISTORY

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Where's Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. <div class="bookquote">`Where's
the boy?'

 (<font color='red'><b>The thieves</b></font>)</div><p/>The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
violence; and looked uneasily at each other.  But they made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's become of the boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by
the collar, and threatening him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) with horrid imprecations.  <div class="bookquote">`Speak out,
or I'll throttle you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who
deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who
conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) turn to be
throttled second, dropped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) knees, and raised a loud,
well-sustained, and continuous roar--something between a mad bull and a
speaking trumpet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Will you speak?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>thundered the Jew:  shaking the Dodger so much that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, the traps have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>), and that's all about it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the
Dodger, sullenly.  <div class="bookquote">`Come, let go o'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>me, will you!'  And, swinging
himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) left in the
Jew's hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass
at the merry old gentleman's waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect,
would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily
replaced.

<p/>The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could
have been anticipated in a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) apparent decrepitude; and,
seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assailant's head.  But
Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) attention by a perfectly
terrific howl, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full
at that young gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled a deep voice. `Who
pitched that <div class="bookquote">`ere at me?  It's well it's the beer, and not the pot, as
hit me, or I'd have settled somebody.  I might have know'd, as nobody
but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to
throw away any drink but water--and not that, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) done the River
Company every quarter.  Wot's it all about, Fagin?  D--me, if my
neck-handkercher an't lined with beer!  Come in, you sneaking warmint;
wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master!
Come in!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of
about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab
breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed
a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;--the kind of legs,
which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete
state without a set of fetters to garnish them.  He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had a brown hat on
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) neck:  with the
long frayed ends of which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) smeared the beer from his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
spoke.  He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) disclosed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had done so, a broad heavy countenance
with a beard of three days' growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which
displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently
damaged by a blow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come in, d'ye hear?'  (<font color='red'><b>this ruffian</b></font>)</div>growled this engaging ruffian.

<p/>A white shaggy dog, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face scratched and torn in twenty
different places, skulked into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why didn't you come in afore?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.  <div class="bookquote">`You're getting too
proud to own me afore company, are you?  Lie down!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the
other end of the room.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared well used to it, however; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound,
and winking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute,
appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What are you up to?  Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious,
in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, seating himself deliberately.
`I wonder they don't murder you!  I would if I was them.  If I'd been
your <div class="bookquote">`prentice, I'd have done it long ago, and--no, I couldn't have
sold you afterwards, for you're fit for nothing but keeping as a
curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don't blow
glass bottles large enough.'

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush! hush! Mr. Sikes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, trembling; <div class="bookquote">`don't speak so loud!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`None of your mistering,'  (<font color='red'><b>the ruffian</b></font>)</div>replied the ruffian; <div class="bookquote">`you always mean
mischief when you come that.  You know my name:  out with it!  I shan't
disgrace it when the time comes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the ruffian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well, then--Bill Sikes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, with abject humility.
<div class="bookquote">`You seem out of humour, Bill.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Sikes/Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`I should think you was rather out of
sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots
about, as you do when you blab and--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Sikes/Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Are you mad?'  (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Sikes/Sikes</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and
pointing towards the boys.

<p/>Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) left
ear, and jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb
show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) then, in cant
terms, with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled,
but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here,
demanded a glass of liquor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And mind you don't poison it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hat upon the
table.

<p/>This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer
with which the Jew bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pale lip as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) turned round to the cupboard,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish
-LRB-at all events-RRB- to improve upon the distiller's ingenuity not very far
from the old gentleman's merry heart.

<p/>After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes
condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious
act led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver's
capture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and
improvements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable
under the circumstances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm afraid,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) may say something which will get
us into trouble.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That's very likely,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>returned Sikes with a malicious grin. <div class="bookquote">`You're
blowed upon, Fagin.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And I'm afraid, you see,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>added the Jew, speaking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had not
noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) did
so,--`I'm afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with
a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than
it would for me, my dear.'

<p/>The man started, and turned round upon the Jew.  But the old
gentleman's shoulders were shrugged up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) ears; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes were
vacantly staring on the opposite wall.

<p/>There was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie
appeared plunged in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by
a certain malicious licking of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) lips seemed to be meditating an
attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) might encounter
in the streets when he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) went out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Somebody must find out wot's been done at the office,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes
in a much lower tone than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had taken since he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) came in.

<p/>The Jew nodded assent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hasn't peached, and is committed, there's no fear till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) comes
out again,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) must be taken care on.  You
must get hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) somehow.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Again the Jew nodded.

<p/>The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but,
unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being
adopted.  This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and
Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and
deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or
pretext whatever.

<p/>How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of
uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to
guess.  It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject,
however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver
had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The very thing!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`Bet will go; won't you, my dear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Wheres?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>inquired the young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Only just up to the office, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew coaxingly.

<p/>It is due to the young lady to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not positively affirm
that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) merely expressed an emphatic and
earnest desire to be <div class="bookquote">`blessed'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would; a polite and delicate
evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been
possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict
upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal.

<p/>The Jew's countenance fell.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) turned from this young lady, who was
gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and
yellow curl-papers, to the other female.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nancy, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew in a soothing manner, <div class="bookquote">`what do YOU say?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That it won't do; so it's no use a-trying it on, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you mean by that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly
manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What I say, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the lady collectedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, you're just the very person for it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>reasoned Mr. Sikes: <div class="bookquote">`nobody
about here knows anything of you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And as I don't want 'em to, neither,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy in the same
composed manner, <div class="bookquote">`it's rather more no than yes with me, Bill.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'ll go, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) won't, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) will, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.

<p/>And Mr. Sikes was right.  By dint of alternate threats, promises, and
bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake
the commission.  She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not, indeed, withheld by the same
considerations as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) agreeable friend; for, having recently removed
into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb
of Ratcliffe, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not under the same apprehension of being
recognised by any of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) numerous acquaintances.

<p/>Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gown, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both articles of dress
being provided from the Jew's inexhaustible stock,--Miss Nancy prepared
to issue forth on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) errand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stop a minute, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, producing, a little covered
basket.  <div class="bookquote">`Carry that in one hand.  It looks more respectable, my dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) a door-key to carry in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) t`other one, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes;
<div class="bookquote">`it looks real and genivine like.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, hanging a large
street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady's right hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There; very good!  Very good indeed, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, rubbing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, my brother!  My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket
and the street-door key in an agony of distress.  <div class="bookquote">`What has become of
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)!  Where have they taken him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to!  Oh, do have pity, and tell me
what's been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you
please, gentlemen!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone:
to the immeasurable delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hearers:  Miss Nancy paused, winked
to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'s a clever girl, my dears,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
young friends, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head gravely, as if in mute admonition
to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'s a honour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) sex,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) glass, and
smiting the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) enormous fist.  <div class="bookquote">`Here's her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) health, and
wishing they was all like her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the
accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way to the
police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity
consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.

<p/>Entering by the back way, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tapped softly with the key at one of the
cell-doors, and listened.  There was no sound within:  so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) coughed
and listened again.  Still there was no reply:  so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nolly, dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; <div class="bookquote">`Nolly?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been
taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society
having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr.
Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and
amusing remark that since he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) had so much breath to spare, it would be
more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical
instrument.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the
loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the
county:  so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a faint and feeble voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is there a little boy here?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the voice; <div class="bookquote">`God forbid.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for _not_
playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and
doing nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) livelihood.  In the next cell was another man,
who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without
license; thereby doing something for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) living, in defiance of the
Stamp-office.

<p/>But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or
knew anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in
the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and
lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of
the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) own dear
brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I haven't got him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, the gentleman's got him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>replied the officer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What gentleman!  Oh, gracious heavens!  What gentleman?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Nancy.

<p/>In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the
deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office,
and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to
have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the
prosecutor had carried him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) away, in an insensible condition, to his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) own
residence:  of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that
it was somewhere in Pentonville, he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) having heard that word mentioned in
the directions to the coachman.

<p/>In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman
staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) faltering walk for a
swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could
think of, to the domicile of the Jew.

<p/>Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered,
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hat,
expeditiously departed:  without devoting any time to the formality of
wishing the company good-morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We must know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) is, my dears; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) must be found,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew
greatly excited.  <div class="bookquote">`Charley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring
home some news of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)!  Nancy, my dear, I must have him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) found.  I trust
to you, my dear,--to you and the Artful for everything!  Stay, stay,'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; <div class="bookquote">`there's money,
my dears.  I shall shut up this shop to-night.  You'll know where to
find me!  Don't stop here a minute.  Not an instant, my dears!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pushed them from the room:  and carefully
double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of
concealment the box which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver.
Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clothing.

<p/>A rap at the door startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in this occupation.  <div class="bookquote">`Who's there?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
cried in a shrill tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Me!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What now?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>inquired the
Dodger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) lays hands on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>).  Find him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>),
find him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) out, that's all.  I shall know what to do next; never fear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy murmured a reply of intelligence:  and hurried downstairs after
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) companions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has not peached so far,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) occupation.
<div class="bookquote">`If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) means to blab us among his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) new friends, we may stop his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) mouth
yet.'



 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIV

<p/>COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER'S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW'S, WITH
THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM,
WHEN HE (<font color='blue'><b>GRIMWIG</b></font>) WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND

<p/>Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow's
abrupt exclamation had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), the subject of the picture was
carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the
conversation that ensued:  which indeed bore no reference to Oliver's
history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse
without exciting him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was still too weak to get up to breakfast;
but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) came down into the housekeeper's room next day, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) first
act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again
looking on the face of the beautiful lady.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) expectations were
disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver's eyes.
<div class="bookquote">`It is gone, you see.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I see it is ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`Why have they taken it away?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it
seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you
know,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, no, indeed.  It didn't worry me, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`I liked to
see it.  I quite loved it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, good-humouredly; <div class="bookquote">`you get well as fast
as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There!  I promise
you that!  Now, let us talk about something else.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at
that time.  As the old lady had been so kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) illness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) listened
attentively to a great many stories she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), about an amiable and
handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome
man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a
merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man,
and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought
the tears into her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) eyes to talk about them.  When the old lady had
expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) children, and the
merits of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone,
poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea.
After tea she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) learnt as
quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could teach:  and at which game they played, with great
interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some
warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily
to bed.

<p/>They were happy days, those of Oliver's recovery.  Everything was so
quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after
the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had always lived, it
seemed like Heaven itself.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was no sooner strong enough to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and
a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).  As Oliver
was told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) liked with the old clothes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) gave
them to a servant who had been very kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to sell
them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.  This she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) very readily
did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew
roll them up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bag and walk away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt quite delighted to think
that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ever being able to wear them again.  They were sad rags, to tell
the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.

<p/>One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was
sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr.
Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) should like to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) study, and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) a little while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bless us, and save us!  Wash your hands, and let me part your hair
nicely for you, child,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bedwin.  <div class="bookquote">`Dear heart alive!  If we
had known he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean
collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver did as the old lady bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and, although she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lamented
grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little
frill that bordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) shirt-collar; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looked so delicate and
handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went so
far as to say:  looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) with great complacency from head to
foot, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) really didn't think it would have been possible, on the
longest notice, to have made much difference in him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) for the better.

<p/>Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door.  On Mr. Brownlow
calling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to come in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) found himself in a little back room,
quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little
gardens.  There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr.
Brownlow was seated reading.  When he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) saw Oliver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pushed the book
away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to come near the table, and sit down.
Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read
such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world
wiser.  Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver
Twist, every day of their lives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the
shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A great number, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`I never saw so many.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You shall read them, if you behave well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman
kindly; <div class="bookquote">`and you will like that, better than looking at the
outsides,--that is, some cases; because there are books of which the
backs and covers are by far the best parts.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, pointing to
some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not always those,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head,
and smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did so; <div class="bookquote">`there are other equally heavy ones, though
of a much smaller size.  How should you like to grow up a clever man,
and write books, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I think I would rather read them, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What! wouldn't you like to be a book-writer?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman.

<p/>Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should think it
would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old
gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had said a very good thing.
Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) by no means knew what it
was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, composing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) features. <div class="bookquote">`Don't be
afraid!  We won't make an author of you, while there's an honest trade
to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Thank you, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver.  At the earnest manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) reply, the
old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious
instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention
to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the
same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
assume yet, <div class="bookquote">`I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am
going to say.  I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am
sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would
be.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, don't tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman's
commencement!  <div class="bookquote">`Don't turn me out of doors to wander in the streets
again.  Let me stay here, and be a servant.  Don't send me back to the
wretched place I came from.  Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`My dear child,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of
Oliver's sudden appeal; <div class="bookquote">`you need not be afraid of my deserting you,
unless you give me cause.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I never, never will, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>interposed Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>rejoined the old gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`I do not think you ever
will.  I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have
endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you,
nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well
account for, even to myself.  The persons on whom I have bestowed my
dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and
delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my
heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections.  Deep
affliction has but strengthened and refined them.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>As the old gentleman said this in a low voice:  more to himself than to
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) companion:  and as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) remained silent for a short time afterwards:
Oliver sat quite still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful
tone, <div class="bookquote">`I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing
that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful,
perhaps, not to wound me again.  You say you are an orphan, without a
friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make,
confirm the statement.  Let me hear your story; where you come from;
who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found
you.  Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver's sobs checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) utterance for some minutes; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was on
the point of beginning to relate how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been brought up at the
farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly
impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door:  and the
servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) coming up?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Brownlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>replied the servant.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) asked if there were any muffins
in the house; and, when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had come to tea.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was
an old friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) must not mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) being a little rough in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) manners; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) was a worthy creature at bottom, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) had reason
to know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Shall I go downstairs, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`I would rather you remained here.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment, there walked into the room:  supporting himself by a
thick stick:  a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was
dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and
gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with
green.  A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) waistcoat;
and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end,
dangled loosely below it.  The ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) white neckerchief were
twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes
into which his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) countenance was twisted, defy description.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a
manner of screwing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head on one side when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spoke; and of looking
out of the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes at the same time:  which irresistibly
reminded the beholder of a parrot.  In this attitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fixed himself,
the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appearance; and, holding out a small piece of
orange-peel at arm's length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Look here! do you see this!  Isn't it a most wonderful and
extraordinary thing that I can't call at a man's house but I find a
piece of this poor surgeon's friend on the staircase? I've been lamed
with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I'll
be content to eat my own head, sir!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed
nearly every assertion he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) made; and it was the more singular in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)
case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility
of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable
a gentleman to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own head in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) being so disposed,
Mr. Grimwig's head was such a particularly large one, that the most
sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get
through it at a sitting--to put entirely out of the question, a very
thick coating of powder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll eat my head, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) stick upon
the ground.  <div class="bookquote">`Hallo! what's that!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>looking at Oliver, and retreating a
pace or two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brownlow.

<p/>Oliver bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You don't mean to say that's the boy who had the fever, I hope?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more.  <div class="bookquote">`Wait a minute! Don't speak!
Stop--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) triumph at the discovery; <div class="bookquote">`that's the boy who had the orange!
If that's not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of
peel upon the staircase, I'll eat my head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) too.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has not had one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. <div class="bookquote">`Come!  Put
down your hat; and speak to my young friend.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I feel strongly on this subject, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the irritable old
gentleman, drawing off his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloves.  <div class="bookquote">`There's always more or less
orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I _know_ it's put there
by the surgeon's boy at the corner.  A young woman stumbled over a bit
last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got up I
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) look towards his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light.
``Don't go to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),'' I called out of the window, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s an assassin!  A
man-trap!''  So he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is not--'   (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>Here the irascible old
gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stick; which was
always understood, by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friends, to imply the customary offer,
whenever it was not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stick
in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver:  who,
seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's the boy, is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, at length.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's the boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`How are you, boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A great deal better, thank you, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/>Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) singular friend was about
to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell
Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did not half like the
visitor's manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was very happy to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is a nice-looking boy, is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Brownlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't know?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No.  I don't know.  I never see any difference in boys.  I only knew
two sort of boys.  Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And which is Oliver?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Mealy.  I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they
call him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid
boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams
of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a
wolf.  I know him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>)!  The wretch!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Come,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`these are not the characteristics of young
Oliver Twist; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) needn't excite your wrath.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`They are not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Grimwig.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) may have worse.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr.
Grimwig the most exquisite delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) may have worse, I say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Grimwig.  <div class="bookquote">`Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) come
from!  Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)?  What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)?  He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) has had a fever.  What of that?
Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they?  Bad people have
fevers sometimes; haven't they, eh?  I knew a man who was hung in
Jamaica for murdering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had a fever six times; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wasn't recommended to mercy on that account.  Pooh! nonsense!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own heart, Mr.
Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's appearance and
manner were unusually prepossessing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) had a strong appetite for
contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the
orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whether a boy was well-looking or not, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had resolved, from the
first, to oppose his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) friend.  When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one
point of inquiry could he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
had postponed any investigation into Oliver's previous history until he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled
maliciously.  And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper
was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) didn't
find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) would
be content to--and so forth.

<p/>All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous
gentleman:  knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) friend's peculiarities, bore with great good
humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)
entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and
Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ease than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had yet done in the fierce old gentleman's presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of
the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>asked Grimwig of Mr.
Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`To-morrow morning,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`I would rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was
alone with me at the time.  Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten
o'clock, my dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) answered with some hesitation, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was confused by Mr. Grimwig's looking so hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll tell you what,'  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
won't come up to you to-morrow morning.  I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hesitate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is
deceiving you, my good friend.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll swear he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, <div class="bookquote">`I'll--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>and down went the stick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll answer for that boy's truth with my life!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow,
knocking the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And I for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) falsehood with my head!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking
the table also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We shall see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) rising anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile;  <div class="bookquote">`we will.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><p/>As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment,
a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased
of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this
history; having laid them on the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bedwin</b></font>) prepared to leave the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`there is something to
go back.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) has gone, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bedwin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Call after him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`it's particular.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is a poor
man, and they are not paid for.  There are some books to be taken back,
too.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>The street-door was opened.  Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran
another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy;
but there was no boy in sight.  Oliver and the girl returned, in a
breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Dear me, I am very sorry for that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`I
particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Send Oliver with them,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)
will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`I'll run
all the way, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out
on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) should; and that, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) prompt discharge of the
commission, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) should prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) the injustice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) suspicions:  on
this head at least:  at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You _shall_ go, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`The books are on a
chair by my table.  Fetch them down.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arm in
a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was to
take.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You are to say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; <div class="bookquote">`you
are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have
come to pay the four pound ten I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).  This is a five-pound note,
so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I won't be ten minutes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, eagerly.  Having buttoned
up the bank-note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) made a respectful bow, and left the room.  Mrs.
Bedwin followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to the street-door, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) many directions
about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of
the street:  all of which Oliver said he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clearly understood.  Having
superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady
at length permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to depart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bless his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sweet face!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`I can't
bear, somehow, to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) go out of my sight.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) turned
the corner.  The old lady smilingly returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) salutation, and,
closing the door, went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Let me see; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brownlow, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) watch, and placing it on the table.  <div class="bookquote">`It will
be dark by that time.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! you really expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) to come back, do you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Grimwig.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.

<p/>The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig's breast, at the
moment; and it was rendered stronger by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) friend's confident smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) said, smiting the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) fist, <div class="bookquote">`I do not. The boy has
a new suit of clothes on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back, a set of valuable books under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
arm, and a five-pound note in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll join his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) old friends
the thieves, and laugh at you.  If ever that boy returns to this house,
sir, I'll eat my head.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chair closer to the table; and there the
two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.

<p/>It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our
own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and
hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a
bad-hearted man, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) would have been unfeignedly sorry to see
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) respected friend duped and deceived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) really did most earnestly
and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.

<p/>It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely
discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in
silence, with the watch between them.



<p/>CHAPTER XV

<p/>SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY
WERE

<p/>In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of
Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light
burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in
the summer:  there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a
small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a
velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by
that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated
to recognise as Mr. William Sikes.  At his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) feet, sat a white-coated,
red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh
cut on one side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) mouth, which appeared to be the result of some
recent conflict.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Keep quiet, you warmint!  Keep quiet!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, suddenly
breaking silence.  Whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) meditations were so intense as to be
disturbed by the dog's winking, or whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) feelings were so wrought
upon by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) reflections that they required all the relief derivable
from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for
argument and consideration.  Whatever was the cause, the effect was a
kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.

<p/>Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by
their masters; but Mr. Sikes's dog, having faults of temper in common
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a
powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth
in one of the half-boots.  Having given in a hearty shake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) retired,
growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr.
Sikes levelled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You would, would you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and
deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) drew
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pocket.  <div class="bookquote">`Come here, you born devil!  Come here!  D'ye hear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>The dog</b></font>)</div><p/>The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest
key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some
unaccountable objection to having his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) throat cut, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) remained where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
was, and growled more fiercely than before:  at the same time grasping
the end of the poker between his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth, and biting at it like a wild
beast.

<p/>This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) knees, began to assail the animal most furiously.  The dog jumped
from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and
barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the
struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the
door suddenly opening, the dog darted out:  leaving Bill Sikes with the
poker and the clasp-knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hands.

<p/>There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage.  Mr.
Sikes, being disappointed of the dog's participation, at once
transferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) share in the quarrel to the new comer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes,
with a fierce gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I didn't know, my dear, I didn't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, humbly; for the
Jew was the new comer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Didn't know, you white-livered thief!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`Couldn't you
hear the noise?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a sound of it, as I'm a living man, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh no!  You hear nothing, you don't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>retorted Sikes with a fierce
sneer.  <div class="bookquote">`Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go!  I
wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew with a forced smile.

<p/>'Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as
haven't half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes,'
replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look;
<div class="bookquote">`that's why.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to
laugh at the pleasantry of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) friend.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was obviously very ill at
ease, however.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Grin away,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) with
savage contempt; <div class="bookquote">`grin away.  You'll never have the laugh at me,
though, unless it's behind a nightcap.  I've got the upper hand over
you, Fagin; and, d--me, I'll keep it.  There!  If I go, you go; so take
care of me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`I know all that; we--we--have a
mutual interest, Bill,--a mutual interest.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Humph,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) thought the interest lay rather more on
the Jew's side than on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`Well, what have you got to say to me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's all passed safe through the melting-pot,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`and
this is your share.  It's rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but
as I know you'll do me a good turn another time, and--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Stow that gammon,'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>interposed the robber, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">`Where is it?
Hand over!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew,
soothingly.  <div class="bookquote">`Here it is!  All safe!'   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) drew forth an
old cotton handkerchief from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) breast; and untying a large knot in
one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet.  Sikes, snatching it
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it
contained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is all, is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`All,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come
along, have you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes, suspiciously. <div class="bookquote">`Don't put on an
injured look at the question; you've done it many a time. Jerk the
tinkler.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.
It was answered by another Jew:  younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile
and repulsive in appearance.

<p/>Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure.  The Jew, perfectly
understanding the hint, retired to fill it:  previously exchanging a
remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes for an instant, as if
in expectation of it, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head in reply; so slightly that the
action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third
person.  It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie
the boot-lace which the dog had torn.  Possibly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had observed the
brief interchange of signals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) might have thought that it boded no
good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is anybody here, Barney?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that
Sikes was looking on, without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes from the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Dot a shoul,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>replied Barney; whose words:  whether they came from the
heart or not:  made their way through the nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nobody?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise:  which perhaps might
mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Dobody but Biss Dadsy,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>replied Barney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nancy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sikes.  `Where?  Strike me blind, if I don't honour
that <div class="bookquote">`ere girl, for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) native talents.'

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>replied Barney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. <div class="bookquote">`Send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
here.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div><p/>Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining
silent, and not lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) eyes from the ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) retired; and
presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the
bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes, proffering the
glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, I am, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady, disposing of its contents;
<div class="bookquote">`and tired enough of it I am, too.  The young brat's been ill and
confined to the crib; and--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, Nancy, dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, looking up.

<p/>Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew's red eye-brows, and a
half closing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was
disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.
The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)
suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr.
Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes'
time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy
pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) shoulders, and declared it was time to go.
Mr. Sikes, finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was walking a short part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) way himself,
expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) intention of accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>); they went away together,
followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard
as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) master was out of sight.

<p/>The Jew thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head out of the room door when Sikes had left it;
looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) as we walked up the dark passage; shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) clenched
fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated
himself at the table; where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was soon deeply absorbed in the
interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.

<p/>Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) was within so very
short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) way to the
book-stall.  When he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) got into Clerkenwell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) accidently turned down a
by-street which was not exactly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) way; but not discovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>)
mistake until he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in
the right direction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) did not think it worth while to turn back; and
so marched on, as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) could, with the books under his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) arm.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) ought to
feel; and how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) would give for only one look at poor little Dick,
who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment;
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh, my
dear brother!'   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had hardly looked up, to see what the matter
was, when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, struggling.  <div class="bookquote">`Let go of me.  Who is it? What are
you stopping me for?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from
the young woman who had embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and who had a little basket and a
street-door key in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh my gracious!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman, <div class="bookquote">`I have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)!  Oh! Oliver!
Oliver!  Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your
account!  Come home, dear, come.  Oh, I've found him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  Thank gracious
goodness heavins, I've found him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)!'   (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>With these incoherent exclamations,
the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully
hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a
butcher's boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was
also looking on, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't think he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had better run for the
doctor.  To which, the butcher's boy:  who appeared of a lounging, not
to say indolent disposition:  replied, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, no, no, never mind,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman, grasping Oliver's hand;
<div class="bookquote">`I'm better now.  Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the young woman, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ran away, near a month ago,
from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went
and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
mother's heart.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Young wretch!'  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>said one woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Go home, do, you little brute,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I am not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, greatly alarmed.  <div class="bookquote">`I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I
haven't any sister, or father and mother either.  I'm an orphan; I live
at Pentonville.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Only hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) braves it out!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>cried the young woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, it's Nancy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) face for the first
time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You see he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knows me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
can't help himself.  Make him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) come home, there's good people, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll
kill his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) dear mother and father, and break my heart!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What the devil's this?'  (<font color='red'><b>a man Oliver</b></font>)</div>said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with
a white dog at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heels; <div class="bookquote">`young Oliver! Come home to your poor mother,
you young dog!  Come home directly.'

 (<font color='red'><b>a dog</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't belong to them.  I don't know them.  Help! help!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried
Oliver, struggling in the man's powerful grasp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Help!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>repeated the man.  <div class="bookquote">`Yes; I'll help you, you young rascal!

<p/>What books are these?  You've been a stealing 'em, have you? Give 'em
here.'   (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>With these words, the man tore the volumes from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grasp, and
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's right!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. <div class="bookquote">`That's the
only way of bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`To be sure!'  (<font color='red'><b>a carpenter</b></font>)</div>cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look
at the garret-window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It'll do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good!'  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>said the two women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall have it, too!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>rejoined the man, administering another
blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar.  <div class="bookquote">`Come on, you young villain!
Here, Bull's-eye, mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), boy!  Mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of
the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the
brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really was the hardened little wretch he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was described to be;
what could one poor child do!  Darkness had set in; it was a low
neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless.  In another
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was
forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dared to
give utterance to, unintelligible.  It was of little moment, indeed,
whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for
them, had they been ever so plain.


<p/>*      *      *      *      *

<p/>The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the
open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if
there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat,
perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.



<p/>CHAPTER XVI

<p/>RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY

<p/>The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open
space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other
indications of a cattle-market.  Sikes slackened his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pace when they
reached this spot:  the girl being quite unable to support any longer,
the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked.  Turning to Oliver,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) roughly commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to take hold of Nancy's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you hear?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.

<p/>They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.

<p/>Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Give me the other,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, seizing Oliver's unoccupied hand.
<div class="bookquote">`Here, Bull's-Eye!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The dog</b></font>)</div><p/>The dog looked up, and growled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`See here, boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) other hand to Oliver's throat;
<div class="bookquote">`if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) speaks ever so soft a word, hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)!  D'ye mind!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>The dog growled again; and licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lips, eyed Oliver as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) were
anxious to attach himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) windpipe without delay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) isn't!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said
Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval.
<div class="bookquote">`Now, you know what you've got to expect, master, so call away as quick
as you like; the dog will soon stop that game.  Get on, young`un!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Bull</b></font>)</div><p/>Bull's-eye wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tail in acknowledgment of this unusually
endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl
for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.

<p/>It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been
Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night
was dark and foggy.  The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle
through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the
streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger
in Oliver's eyes; and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) uncertainty the more dismal and
depressing.

<p/>They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the
hour.  With its first stroke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) two conductors stopped, and turned
their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Eight o'  (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Sikes/Sikes</b></font>)</div>clock, Bill,' said Nancy, when the bell ceased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can't I!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied
Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I wonder whether THEY can hear it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Nancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course they can,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`It was Bartlemy time when I was
shopped; and there warn't a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn't
hear the squeaking on.  Arter I was locked up for the night, the row
and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could
almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Poor fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy, who still had her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) face turned towards the
quarter in which the bell had sounded.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh, Bill, such fine young
chaps as them!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes; that's all you women think of,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>answered Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Fine young
chaps!  Well, they're as good as dead, so it don't much matter.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency
to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver's wrist more firmly, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to step
out again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Wait a minute!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl:  <div class="bookquote">`I wouldn't hurry by, if it was you
that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o'clock struck,
Bill.  I'd walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow
was on the ground, and I hadn't a shawl to cover me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And what good would that do?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes.
<div class="bookquote">`Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout
rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at
all, for all the good it would do me.  Come on, and don't stand
preaching there.'

 (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl burst into a laugh; drew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shawl more closely round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and
they walked away.  But Oliver felt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand tremble, and, looking up in
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly
white.

<p/>They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full
half-hour:  meeting very few people, and those appearing from their
looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself.
At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of
old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there
was no further occasion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) keeping on guard, stopped before the
door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was
in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating
that it was to let:  which looked as if it had hung there for many
years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`All right,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.

<p/>Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.
They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few
moments under a lamp.  A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised,
was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened.  Mr. Sikes then
seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and
all three were quickly inside the house.

<p/>The passage was perfectly dark.  They waited, while the person who had
let them in, chained and barred the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Anybody here?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied a voice, which Oliver thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had heard before.

<p/>`Is the old <div class="bookquote">`un here?'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>asked the robber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the voice, <div class="bookquote">`and precious down in the mouth he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) has been.
Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) be glad to see you?  Oh, no!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it,
seemed familiar to Oliver's ears:  but it was impossible to distinguish
even the form of the speaker in the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Let's have a glim,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`or we shall go breaking our necks, or
treading on the dog.  Look after your legs if you do!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Stand still a moment, and I'll get you one,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the voice. The
receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute,
the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) bore in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft
stick.

<p/>The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of
recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away,
beckoned the visitors to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) down a flight of stairs. They
crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low
earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small
back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, my wig, my wig!'  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the
laughter had proceeded:  <div class="bookquote">`here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is! oh, cry, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is!  Oh, Fagin,
look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)!  Fagin, do look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)! I can't bear it; it is such a
jolly game, I cant'  (<font color='red'><b>Charles Bates</b></font>)</div>bear it.  Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.'

<p/>With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself
flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an
ectasy of facetious joy.  Then jumping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) snatched the
cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) round
and round; while the Jew, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) nightcap, made a great number
of low bows to the bewildered boy.  The Artful, meantime, who was of a
rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it
interfered with business, rifled Oliver's pockets with steady assiduity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) togs, Fagin!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley, putting the light so close to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) new jacket as nearly to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) on fire.  <div class="bookquote">`Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) togs!
Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut!  Oh, my eye, what a game!
And his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) books, too!  Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, bowing
with mock humility.  <div class="bookquote">`The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear,
for fear you should spoil that Sunday one.  Why didn't you write, my
dear, and say you were coming?  We'd have got something warm for
supper.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div><p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed,
and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound
note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery
awakened his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) merriment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hallo, what's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew
seized the note.  <div class="bookquote">`That's mine, Fagin.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`Mine, Bill, mine.  You shall have
the books.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If that ain't mine!'  (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Sikes/Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Bill Sikes, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hat with a
determined air; <div class="bookquote">`mine and Nancy's that is; I'll take the boy back
again.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Sikes/Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew started.  Oliver started too, though from a very different
cause; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hoped that the dispute might really end in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) being
taken back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come!  Hand over, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the
Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Fair, or not fair,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>retorted Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`hand over, I tell you! Do you
think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time
but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as
gets grabbed through you?  Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton,
give it here!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between
the Jew's finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face,
folded it up small, and tied it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) neckerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's for our share of the trouble,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`and not half
enough, neither.  You may keep the books, if you're fond of reading.
If you ain't, sell 'em.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`They're very pretty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces,
had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; <div class="bookquote">`beautiful
writing, isn't is, Oliver?'   (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>At sight of the dismayed look with which
Oliver regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a
lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more
boisterous than the first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`They belong to the old gentleman,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands;
<div class="bookquote">`to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) house, and had
me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back;
send him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) back the books and money.  Keep me here all my life long; but
pray, pray send them back.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll think I stole them; the old lady:
all of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them.  Oh, do
have mercy upon me, and send them back!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate
grief, Oliver fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knees at the Jew's feet; and beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands
together, in perfect desperation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The boy's right,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot.  <div class="bookquote">`You're right, Oliver, you're
right; they WILL think you have stolen 'em.  Ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>chuckled the Jew,
rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">`it couldn't have happened better, if we had chosen
our time!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course it couldn't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`I know'd that, directly I see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) arm.  It's all
right enough.  They're soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn't
have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) in at all; and they'll ask no questions after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), fear
they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lagged.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s safe
enough.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being
spoken, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what
passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) jumped suddenly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) feet,
and tore wildly from the room:  uttering shrieks for help, which made
the bare old house echo to the roof.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Keep back the dog, Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>cried Nancy, springing before the door, and
closing it, as the Jew and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) two pupils darted out in pursuit.  <div class="bookquote">`Keep
back the dog; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)'ll tear the boy to pieces.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) right!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from
the girl's grasp.  <div class="bookquote">`Stand off from me, or I'll split your head against
the wall.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't care for that, Bill, I don't care for that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>screamed the
girl, struggling violently with the man, <div class="bookquote">`the child shan't be torn down
by the dog, unless you kill me first.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Shan't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth.  <div class="bookquote">`I'll soon do that, if you
don't keep off.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The housebreaker</b></font>)</div><p/>The housebreaker flung the girl from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to the further end of the
room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the matter here!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, looking round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The girl's gone mad, I think,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, savagely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hasn't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle;
<div class="bookquote">`no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hasn't, Fagin; don't think it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then keep quiet, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, with a threatening look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, I won't do that, neither,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy, speaking very loud.
<div class="bookquote">`Come!  What do you think of that?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs
of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel
tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any
conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), at present.  With the view of diverting the
attention of the company, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) turned to Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, taking up
a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; <div class="bookquote">`eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver made no reply.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) watched the Jew's motions, and breathed
quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>sneered the
Jew, catching the boy by the arm.  <div class="bookquote">`We'll cure you of that, my young
master.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver's shoulders with the club; and
was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flung it into the fire, with a force that brought
some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I won't stand by and see it done, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>cried the girl. <div class="bookquote">`You've got
the boy, and what more would you have?--Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) be--let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) be--or I
shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows
before my time.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) foot violently on the floor as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) vented this
threat; and with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips compressed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands clenched, looked
alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face quite colourless
from the passion of rage into which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had gradually worked herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, Nancy!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted
manner; <div class="bookquote">`you,--you're more clever than ever to-night.  Ha! ha! my dear,
you are acting beautifully.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Am I!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`Take care I don't overdo it.  You will be the
worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep
clear of me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>There is something about a roused woman: especially if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) add to all
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and
despair; which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be
hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss
Nancy's rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a
glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.

<p/>Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) personal
pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy
to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and
threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the
fertility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) invention. As they produced no visible effect on the
object against whom they were discharged, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) resorted to more
tangible arguments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you mean by this?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very
common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features:
which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand
times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a
disorder as measles: <div class="bookquote">`what do you mean by it?  Burn my body!  Do you
know who you are, and what you are?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, yes, I know all about it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, laughing
hysterically; and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head from side to side, with a poor
assumption of indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, then, keep quiet,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was
accustomed to use when addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) dog, <div class="bookquote">`or I'll quiet you for a
good long time to come.'

 (<font color='red'><b>dog</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting
a hasty look at Sikes, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face aside, and bit her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lip till the
blood came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You're a nice one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>added Sikes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with a
contemptuous air, <div class="bookquote">`to take up the humane and gen--teel side!  A pretty
subject for the child, as you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), to make a friend of!'

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`God Almighty help me, I am!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl passionately; <div class="bookquote">`and I wish
I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them
we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>)
here.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>)'s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that's bad, from this night
forth.  Isn't that enough for the old wretch, without blows?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Come, come, Sikes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew appealing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) in a remonstratory
tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all
that passed; <div class="bookquote">`we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Civil words!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see.
<div class="bookquote">`Civil words, you villain!  Yes, you deserve 'em from me. I thieved for
you when I was a child not half as old as this!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>pointing to Oliver.
<div class="bookquote">`I have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve
years since.  Don't you know it?  Speak out!  Don't you know it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; <div class="bookquote">`and,
if you have, it's your living!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Aye, it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl speaking</b></font>)</div>returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the
words in one continuous and vehement scream.  <div class="bookquote">`It is my living; and the
cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you're the wretch that drove
me to them long ago, and that'll keep me there, day and night, day and
night, till I die!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I shall do you a mischief!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>interposed the Jew, goaded by these
reproaches; <div class="bookquote">`a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair and dress in a
transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably
have left signal marks of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) revenge upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), had not her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wrists been
seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made a few
ineffectual struggles, and fainted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s all right now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) down in a corner. <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s
uncommon strong in the arms, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s up in this way.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have
the disturbance over; but neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the
boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance
incidental to business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's the worst of having to do with women,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, replacing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) club; <div class="bookquote">`but they're clever, and we can't get on, in our line,
without 'em.  Charley, show Oliver to bed.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'d better not wear his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>inquired Charley Bates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Certainly not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which
Charley put the question.

<p/>Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) commission, took the
cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were
two or three of the beds on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had slept before; and here, with
many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) produced the identical old
suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon
leaving off at Mr. Brownlow's; and the accidental display of which, to
Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue
received, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) whereabout.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Put off the smart ones,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley, <div class="bookquote">`and I'll give 'em to Fagin to
take care of.  What fun it is!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Oliver unwillingly complied.  Master Bates rolling up the new
clothes under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the
dark, and locking the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/>The noise of Charley's laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who
opportunely arrived to throw water over her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) friend, and perform other
feminine offices for the promotion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) recovery, might have kept
many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which
Oliver was placed.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was sick and weary; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) soon fell sound
asleep.



<p/>CHAPTER XVII

<p/>OLIVER'S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON
TO INJURE HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) REPUTATION

<p/>It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to
present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as
the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon.  The hero sinks
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the
next scene, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience
with a comic song.  We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in
the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) virtue and her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) life alike
in danger, drawing forth her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) dagger to preserve the one at the cost of
the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest
pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the
great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny
chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of
places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company,
carolling perpetually.

<p/>Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would
seem at first sight.  The transitions in real life from well-spread
boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are
not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of
passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference.  The actors in the
mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt
impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of
mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.

<p/>As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place,
are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many
considered as the great art of authorship: an author's skill in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>)
craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the
dilemmas in which he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) characters at the end of every chapter:
this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed
unnecessary.  If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the
part of the historian that he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) is going back to the town in which Oliver
Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good
and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would not be
invited to proceed upon such an expedition.

<p/>Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked
with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was
in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat and coat were
dazzling in the morning sun; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane with the vigorous
tenacity of health and power.  Mr. Bumble always carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head high;
but this morning it was higher than usual.  There was an abstraction in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eye, an elevation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) air, which might have warned an observant
stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle's mind, too great for
utterance.

<p/>Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and
others who spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), deferentially, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) passed along.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) merely
returned their salutations with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hand, and relaxed not in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) dignified pace, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended
the infant paupers with parochial care.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Drat that beadle!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking at
the garden-gate.  <div class="bookquote">`If it isn't him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) at this time in the morning!  Lauk,
Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you!  Well, dear me, it IS a
pleasure, this is!  Come into the parlour, sir, please.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of
delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the
garden-gate: and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), with great attention and respect, into the
house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Mann,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself
into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself
gradually and slowly down into a chair; <div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Mann, ma'am, good
morning.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, and good morning to _you_, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Mann, with many
smiles; <div class="bookquote">`and hoping you find yourself well, sir!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So-so, Mrs. Mann,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle.  <div class="bookquote">`A porochial life is not a bed
of roses, Mrs. Mann.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, that it isn't indeed, Mr. Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the lady. And all the
infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety,
if they had heard it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A porochial life, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the infant paupers</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane, <div class="bookquote">`is a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but
all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>)
hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!  You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle.

<p/>Finding she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again:  evidently to the
satisfaction of the public character:  who, repressing a complacent
smile by looking sternly at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) cocked hat, said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Mann, I am going to London.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the character</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Lauk, Mr. Bumble!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Mann, starting back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`To London, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>resumed the inflexible beadle, <div class="bookquote">`by coach.  I and
two paupers, Mrs. Mann!  A legal action is a coming on, about a
settlement; and the board has appointed me--me, Mrs. Mann--to dispose
to the matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell.

<p/>And I very much question,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up,
<div class="bookquote">`whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong
box before they have done with me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! you mustn't be too hard upon them, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, coaxingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma'am,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they
come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have
only themselves to thank.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing
manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs.
Mann appeared quite awed by them. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You're going by coach, sir?  I thought it was always usual to send
them paupers in carts.'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That's when they're ill, Mrs. Mann,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle.  <div class="bookquote">`We put the
sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their
taking cold.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`They are both in a very low state, and we find it
would come two pound cheaper to move 'em than to bury 'em--that is, if
we can throw 'em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to
do, if they don't die upon the road to spite us.  Ha! ha! ha!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes again encountered
the cocked hat; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) became grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We are forgetting business, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle; <div class="bookquote">`here is your
porochial stipend for the month.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
pocket-book; and requested a receipt:  which Mrs. Mann wrote.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's very much blotted, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer of infants; <div class="bookquote">`but it's
formal enough, I dare say.  Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much
obliged to you, I'm sure.'

 (<font color='red'><b>infants</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann's curtsey;
and inquired how the children were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bless their dear little hearts!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann with emotion, <div class="bookquote">`they're
as well as can be, the dears!  Of course, except the two that died last
week.  And little Dick.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Isn't that boy no better?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Bumble.

<p/>Mrs. Mann shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)'s a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble angrily.  <div class="bookquote">`Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) to you in one minute, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Mann. <div class="bookquote">`Here,
you Dick!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick</b></font>)</div><p/>After some calling, Dick was discovered.  Having had his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) face put under
the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann's gown, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was led into the awful
presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.

<p/>The child was pale and thin; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cheeks were sunken; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes large
and bright.  The scanty parish dress, the livery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) misery, hung
loosely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) feeble body; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) young limbs had wasted away, like
those of an old man.

<p/>Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble's
glance; not daring to lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes from the floor; and dreading even
to hear the beadle's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Can't you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann.

<p/>The child meekly raised his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the matter with you, porochial Dick?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Bumble, with
well-timed jocularity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>replied the child faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I should think not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very
much at Mr. Bumble's humour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You want for nothing, I'm sure.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I should like--'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>faltered the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hey-day!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Mann, <div class="bookquote">`I suppose you're going to say that you
DO want for something, now?  Why, you little wretch--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mann</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) hand with a show
of authority.  <div class="bookquote">`Like what, sir, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I should like,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>faltered the child, <div class="bookquote">`if somebody that can write, would
put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and
seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, what does the boy mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the
earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression:
accustomed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was to such things.  <div class="bookquote">`What do you mean, sir?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I should like,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child, <div class="bookquote">`to leave my dear love to poor Oliver
Twist; and to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) know how often I have sat by myself and cried to
think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>).  And I should like to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) small
hands together, and speaking with great fervour, <div class="bookquote">`that I was glad to
die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man,
and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me,
or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both
children there together.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with
indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) companion, said,
<div class="bookquote">`They're all in one story, Mrs. Mann.  That out-dacious Oliver had
demogalized them all!'

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I couldn't have believed it, sir'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Mann, holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) hands,
and looking malignantly at Dick.  <div class="bookquote">`I never see such a hardened little
wretch!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) away, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble imperiously.  `This must be
stated to the board, Mrs. Mann.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn't my fault, sir?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`They shall understand that, ma'am; they shall be acquainted with the
true state of the case,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`There; take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) away, I
can't bear the sight on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar.  Mr.
Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) journey.

<p/>At six o'clock next morning, Mr. Bumble:  having exchanged his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked
hat for a round one, and encased his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) person in a blue great-coat with a
cape to it:  took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by
the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course
of time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) arrived in London.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated
in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in
shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble
declared, caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) teeth to chatter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) feel
quite uncomfortable; although he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had a great-coat on.

<p/>Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble
sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a
temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. Putting a glass
of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) chair to the
fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of
discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper.

<p/>The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble's eye rested, was the
following advertisement.

<p/>`FIVE GUINEAS REWARD

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on
Thursday evening last, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) home, at Pentonville; and has not since
been heard of.  The above reward will be paid to any person who will
give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver
Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) previous history, in which
the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>And then followed a full description of Oliver's dress, person,
appearance, and disappearance:  with the name and address of Mr.
Brownlow at full length.

<p/>Mr. Bumble opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and
carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes
was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) way to Pentonville: having actually, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) excitement, left
the glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is Mr. Brownlow at home?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened
the door.

<p/>To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive
reply of <div class="bookquote">`I don't know; where do you come from?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver's name, in explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door,
hastened into the passage in a breathless state.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come in, come in,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady: <div class="bookquote">`I knew we should hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).
Poor dear!  I knew we should!  I was certain of it.  Bless his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) heart!
I said so all along.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Having heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour
again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears. The girl, who
was not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now
returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) immediately:
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) did.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them.  The latter
gentleman at once burst into the exclamation:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A beadle.  A parish beadle, or I'll eat my head.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Pray don't interrupt just now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`Take a seat, will
you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr.
Grimwig's manner.  Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an
uninterrupted view of the beadle's countenance; and said, with a little
impatience,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And you ARE a beadle, are you not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Grimwig.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) friend, <div class="bookquote">`I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) was.
A beadle all over!'

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brownlow gently shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) head to impose silence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) friend, and
resumed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you know where this poor boy is now?'

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No more than nobody,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, what DO you know of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>inquired the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`Speak
out, my friend, if you have anything to say.  What DO you know of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You don't happen to know any good of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), do you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig,
caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble's features.

<p/>Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head with
portentous solemnity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You see?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.

<p/>Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble's pursed-up
countenance; and requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) to communicate what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) knew regarding
Oliver, in as few words as possible.

<p/>Mr. Bumble put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat; unbuttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) coat; folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) arms;
inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments'
reflection, commenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) story.

<p/>It would be tedious if given in the beadle's words:  occupying, as it
did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of
it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents.
That he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) birth, displayed no better qualities than
treachery, ingratitude, and malice.  That he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had terminated his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) brief
career in the place of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly
attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master's house.  In proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) really being the person he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had
brought to town. Folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) arms again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) then awaited Mr. Brownlow's
observations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I fear it is all too true,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after
looking over the papers.  <div class="bookquote">`This is not much for your intelligence; but
I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been
favourable to the boy.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this
information at an earlier period of the interview, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) might have
imparted a very different colouring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) little history. It was too
late to do it now, however; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head gravely, and,
pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.

<p/>Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so
much disturbed by the beadle's tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to
vex him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) further.

<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) stopped, and rang the bell violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Bedwin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; <div class="bookquote">`that
boy, Oliver, is an imposter.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It can't be, sir.  It cannot be,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady energetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>retorted the old gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`What do you mean by
can't be?  We have just heard a full account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) birth; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) life.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I never will believe it, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the old lady, firmly. <div class="bookquote">`Never!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying
story-books,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Grimwig.  <div class="bookquote">`I knew it all along. Why didn't
you take my advise in the beginning; you would if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) hadn't had a
fever, I suppose, eh?  He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) was interesting, wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)?  Interesting!
Bah!'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div>retorted Mrs. Bedwin,
indignantly.  <div class="bookquote">`I know what children are, sir; and have done these forty
years; and people who can't say the same, shouldn't say anything about
them.  That's my opinion!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor.  As it extorted
nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head,
and smoothed down her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) apron preparatory to another speech, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
stopped by Mr. Brownlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Silence!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was far from
feeling.  <div class="bookquote">`Never let me hear the boy's name again.  I rang to tell you
that.  Never.  Never, on any pretence, mind!  You may leave the room,
Mrs. Bedwin.  Remember!  I am in earnest.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow's that night.

<p/>Oliver's heart sank within him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) good friends; it
was well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not know what they had heard, or it
might have broken outright.



<p/>CHAPTER XVIII

<p/>HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) REPUTABLE
FRIENDS

<p/>About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to
pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of
reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clearly demonstrated he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been guilty, to no ordinary
extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) anxious
friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so
much trouble and expense had been incurred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recovery. Mr. Fagin
laid great stress on the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) having taken Oliver in, and
cherished him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), when, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) timely aid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) might have perished
with hunger; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) related the dismal and affecting history of a young
lad whom, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) philanthropy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had succoured under parallel
circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) confidence and evincing
a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be
hanged at the Old Bailey one morning.  Mr. Fagin did not seek to
conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young
person in question, had rendered it necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) should become the
victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not
precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) -LRB-Mr.
Fagin-RRB- and a few select friends.  Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a
rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with
great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) anxious
hopes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that
unpleasant operation.

<p/>Little Oliver's blood ran cold, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) listened to the Jew's words, and
imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them.  That it
was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the
guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew already; and
that deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or
over-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by
the Jew on more occasions than one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) thought by no means unlikely,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) recollected the general nature of the altercations between that
gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some
foregone conspiracy of the kind.  As he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) glanced timidly up, and met the
Jew's searching look, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pale face and trembling limbs
were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman.

<p/>The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) saw they
would be very good friends yet.  Then, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hat, and covering
himself with an old patched great-coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went out, and locked the
room-door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/>And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many
subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and
left during the long hours to commune with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own thoughts.  Which,
never failing to revert to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) kind friends, and the opinion they must
long ago have formed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), were sad indeed.

<p/>After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was at liberty to wander about the house.

<p/>It was a very dirty place.  The rooms upstairs had great high wooden
chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the
ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were
ornamented in various ways.  From all of these tokens Oliver concluded
that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to
better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome:  dismal and
dreary as it looked now.

<p/>Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings;
and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would
scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes.  With
these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living
thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was tired of wandering from
room to room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would crouch in the corner of the passage by the
street-door, to be as near living people as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could; and would remain
there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys
returned.

<p/>In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed:  the bars
which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which
was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which
made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows.
There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no
shutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for
hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused
and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.
Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the
parapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again;
and as the window of Oliver's observatory was nailed down, and dimmed
with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could do to make
out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any
attempt to be seen or heard,--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had as much chance of being, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had lived inside the ball of St. Paul's Cathedral.

<p/>One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that
evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head to
evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) person -LRB-to do him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)-RRB-; and, with
this end and aim, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) toilet, straightway.

<p/>Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some
faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the
way of this proposal.  So he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) at once expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) readiness; and,
kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)
could take his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) foot in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) laps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) applied himself to a process which
Mr. Dawkins designated as <div class="bookquote">`japanning his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) trotter-cases.'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawkins/Mr. John Dawkins/John</b></font>)</div>The phrase,
rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) boots.

<p/>Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational
animal may be supposed to feel when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) sits on a table in an easy
attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and
having his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of
having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to
disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco
that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer
that mollified his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) thoughts; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) was evidently tinctured, for the nonce,
with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) general nature.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief
space; and then, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, and heaving a gentle sign, said,
half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What a pity it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) isn't a prig!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>said Master Charles Bates; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) don't know what's good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>Master Charles Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) pipe: as did Charley Bates.
They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I suppose you don't even know what a prig is?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger
mournfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I think I know that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, looking up.  <div class="bookquote">`It's a the--;
you're one, are you not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver, checking himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied the Doger.  <div class="bookquote">`I'd scorn to be anything else.'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawkins/Mr. John Dawkins/John</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Dawkins gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment,
and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would feel obliged
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) saying anything to the contrary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>repeated the Dodger.  <div class="bookquote">`So's Charley.  So's Fagin. So's Sikes.
So's Nancy.  So's Bet.  So we all are, down to the dog. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s the
downiest one of the lot!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And the least given to peaching,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>added Charley Bates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) wouldn't so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing
himself; no, not if you tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) up in one, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) there without
wittles for a fortnight,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>observed Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'s a rum dog.  Don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) look fierce at any strange cove that laughs
or sings when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'s in company!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>pursued the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">`Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) growl at
all, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hears a fiddle playing!  And don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hate other dogs as
ain't of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) breed!  Oh, no!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)'s an out-and-out Christian,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley.

<p/>This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal's abilities, but it
was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only
known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to
be out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes' dog, there
exist strong and singular points of resemblance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they
had strayed: with that mindfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) profession which influenced
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) proceedings.  <div class="bookquote">`This hasn't go anything to do with young Green
here.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No more it has,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley.  <div class="bookquote">`Why don't you put yourself under
Fagin, Oliver?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And make your fortun'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>out of hand?' added the Dodger, with a grin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I
mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the
forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley Bates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't like it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>rejoined Oliver, timidly; <div class="bookquote">`I wish they would let me
go.  I--I--would rather go.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And Fagin would RATHER not!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>rejoined Charley.

<p/>Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to
express his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feelings more openly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) only sighed, and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
boot-cleaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Go!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Dodger.  <div class="bookquote">`Why, where's your spirit?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Don't you take
any pride out of yourself?  Would you go and be dependent on your
friends?'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, blow that!'  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk
handkerchiefs from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard,
<div class="bookquote">`that's too mean; that is.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`_I_ couldn't do it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You can leave your friends, though,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver with a half smile;
<div class="bookquote">`and let them be punished for what you did.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) pipe, <div class="bookquote">`That was all out
of consideration for Fagin, 'cause the traps know that we work
together, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) might have got into trouble if we hadn't made our
lucky; that was the move, wasn't it, Charley?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection
of Oliver's flight came so suddenly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), that the smoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was
inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, and
down into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping,
about five minutes long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Look here!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and
halfpence. <div class="bookquote">`Here's a jolly life!  What's the odds where it comes from?
Here, catch hold; there's plenty more where they were took from.  You
won't, won't you?  Oh, you precious flat!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's naughty, ain't it, Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>inquired Charley Bates. <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)'ll come
to be scragged, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know what that means,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Something in this way, old feller,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charly</b></font>)</div>said Charly.  As he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said it,
Master Bates caught up an end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) neckerchief; and, holding it erect
in the air, dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) shoulder, and jerked a curious
sound through his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic
representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's what it means,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley.  `Look how he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) stares, Jack!

<p/>I never did see such prime company as that <div class="bookquote">`ere boy; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll be the death
of me, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will.'   (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily
again, resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) pipe with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You've been brought up bad,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, surveying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) boots with
much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. <div class="bookquote">`Fagin will make
something of you, though, or you'll be the first he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) ever had that
turned out unprofitable.  You'd better begin at once; for you'll come
to the trade long before you think of it; and you're only losing time,
Oliver.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
own:  which, being exhausted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) friend Mr. Dawkins launched
into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the
life they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the
best thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could do, would be to secure Fagin's favour without more
delay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, as the Jew
was heard unlocking the door above, <div class="bookquote">`if you don't take fogels and
tickers--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the good of talking in that way?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>interposed Master Bates; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
don't know what you mean.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If you don't take pocket-handkechers and watches,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger,
reducing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) conversation to the level of Oliver's capacity, <div class="bookquote">`some
other cove will; so that the coves that lose 'em will be all the worse,
and you'll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha`p`orth the
better, except the chaps wot gets them--and you've just as good a right
to them as they have.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`To be sure, to be sure!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, who had entered unseen by
Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the
Dodger's word for it.  Ha! ha! ha!  He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) understands the catechism of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)
trade.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hands gleefully together, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) corroborated the
Dodger's reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)
pupil's proficiency.

<p/>The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had
returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver
had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom
Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few
gallantries with the lady, now made his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) appearance.

<p/>Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps
numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)
deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius
and professional aquirements.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) had small twinkling eyes, and a
pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy
fustian trousers, and an apron.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) wardrobe was, in truth, rather out
of repair; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) excused himself to the company by stating that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">`time'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having
worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) had not been able to bestow
any attention on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) private clothes.  Mr. Chitling added, with strong
marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder
was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there
was no remedy against the County.  The same remark he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) considered to
apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) held to be
decidedly unlawful.  Mr. Chitling wound up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) observations by stating
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long
hard-working days; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">`wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) might be busted if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) warn't
as dry as a lime-basket.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the
Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the
table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I--I--don't know, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Who's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Chitling</b></font>)</div>inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at
Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A young friend of mine, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)'s in luck, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin.
`Never mind where I came from, young <div class="bookquote">`un; you'll find your way there,
soon enough, I'll bet a crown!'

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>At this sally, the boys laughed.  After some more jokes on the same
subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.

<p/>After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew
their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and
sit by him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), led the conversation to the topics most calculated to
interest his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hearers.  These were, the great advantages of the trade,
the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the
liberality of the Jew himself.  At length these subjects displayed
signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same:
for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two.
Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose.

<p/>From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost
constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with
the Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver's, Mr.
Fagin best knew.  At other times the old man would tell them stories of
robberies he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had committed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) younger days:  mixed up with so much
that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing
heartily, and showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was amused in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) better
feelings.

<p/>In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) toils.  Having prepared
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the
companionship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was
now slowly instilling into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) soul the poison which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hoped would
blacken it, and change its hue for ever.



<p/>CHAPTER XIX

<p/>IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON

<p/>It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
great-coat tight round his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) face:
emerged from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) den.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) paused on the step as the door was locked and
chained behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>); and having listened while the boys made all secure,
and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down
the street as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could.

<p/>The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of
Whitechapel.  The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the
street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck
off in the direction of the Spitalfields.

<p/>The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the
streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and
clammy to the touch.  It seemed just the night when it befitted such a
being as the Jew to be abroad.  As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) glided stealthily along, creeping
beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man
seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and
darkness through which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of
some rich offal for a meal.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon
became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in
that close and densely-populated quarter.

<p/>The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) traversed to be
at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the
intricacies of the way.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hurried through several alleys and streets,
and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the
farther end.  At the door of a house in this street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) knocked; having
exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) walked
upstairs.

<p/>A dog growled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) touched the handle of a room-door; and a man's
voice demanded who was there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew looking in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bring in your body then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Lie down, you stupid brute!
Don't you know the devil when he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'s got a great-coat on?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><p/>Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin's outer
garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a
chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) retired to the corner from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had risen:  wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
tail as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) went, to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was as well satisfied as it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
nature to be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.--`Ah! Nancy.'

<p/>The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to
imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) young friend had
not met, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had interfered in behalf of Oliver.  All doubts upon
the subject, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had any, were speedily removed by the young lady's
behaviour.  She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feet off the fender, pushed back her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair,
and bade Fagin draw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), without saying more about it:  for it was a
cold night, and no mistake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It is cold, Nancy dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) skinny hands
over the fire.  <div class="bookquote">`It seems to go right through one,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>added the old man,
touching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) something to drink, Nancy.  Burn my body, make
haste!  It's enough to turn a man ill, to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lean old carcase
shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were
many:  which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were
filled with several kinds of liquids.  Sikes pouring out a glass of
brandy, bade the Jew drink it off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Quite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, putting down the
glass after just setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) lips to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What!  You're afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes on the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`Ugh!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw
the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony
to filling it again for himself:  which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) did at once.

<p/>The Jew glanced round the room, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) companion tossed down the second
glassful; not in curiousity, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had seen it often before; but in a
restless and suspicious manner habitual to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>). It was a meanly
furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to
induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and
with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three
heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a <div class="bookquote">`life-preserver'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>that
hung over the chimney-piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">`Now I'm ready.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`For business?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`For business,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`so say what you've got to say.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`About the crib at Chertsey, Bill?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) chair
forward, and speaking in a very low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes.  Wot about it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah! you know what I mean, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) knows what I
mean, Nancy; don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) don't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>sneered Mr. Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) won't, and that's the same
thing.  Speak out, and call things by their right names; don't sit
there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you
warn't the very first that thought about the robbery.  Wot d'ye mean?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush, Bill, hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop
this burst of indignation; <div class="bookquote">`somebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody
will hear us.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Let 'em hear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`I don't care.'   (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>But as Mr. Sikes DID care,
on reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) said the words, and grew
calmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There, there,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, coaxingly.  <div class="bookquote">`It was only my caution,
nothing more.  Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to
be done, Bill, eh?  When is it to be done?  Such plate, my dear, such
plate!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew:  rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands, and elevating his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyebrows in
a rapture of anticipation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not to be done at all!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>echoed the Jew, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, not at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`At least it can't be a put-up job,
as we expected.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then it hasn't been properly gone about,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning pale
with anger.  <div class="bookquote">`Don't tell me!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`But I will tell you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>retorted Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Who are you that's not to be
told?  I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place
for a fortnight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) can't get one of the servants in line.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you mean to tell me, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew: softening as the other
grew heated:  <div class="bookquote">`that neither of the two men in the house can be got
over?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, I do mean to tell you so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`The old lady has had
'em these twenty years; and if you were to give 'em five hundred pound,
they wouldn't be in it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`But do you mean to say, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`that the
women can't be got over?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not by flash Toby Crackit?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew incredulously. <div class="bookquote">`Think what
women are, Bill,'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s
worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s
been loitering down there, and it's all of no use.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my
dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) did,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`and they warn't of no more use than the
other plant.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew looked blank at this information.  After ruminating for some
minutes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) chin sunk on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) breast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head and said,
with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) feared
the game was up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And yet,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, <div class="bookquote">`it's a
sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Worse luck!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep
thought, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) face wrinkled into an expression of villainy
perfectly demoniacal.  Sikes eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) furtively from time to time.
Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)
eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had been deaf to all that passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed;
<div class="bookquote">`is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it's safely done from the outside?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is it a bargain?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, my dear, yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>rejoined the Jew; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes glistening, and every
muscle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had
awakened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew's hand, with some disdain,
<div class="bookquote">`let it come off as soon as you like.  Toby and me were over the
garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and
shutters.  The crib's barred up at night like a jail; but there's one
part we can crack, safe and softly.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Which is that, Bill?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>asked the Jew eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>whispered Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`as you cross the lawn--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head forward, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes almost
starting out of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Umph!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew's
face.  <div class="bookquote">`Never mind which part it is. You can't do it without me, I
know; but it's best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`As you like, my dear, as you like'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`Is there no help
wanted, but yours and Toby's?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`None,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Cept a centre-bit and a boy.  The first we've
both got; the second you must find us.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh! then it's a panel, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Never mind wot it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes.  `I want a boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) musn't be
a big <div class="bookquote">`un.  Lord!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, `if I'd only got that
young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper's!  He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) small on
purpose, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) out by the job.  But the father gets lagged; and
then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from
a trade where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was earning money, teaches him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to read and write, and
in time makes a <div class="bookquote">`prentice of him (<font color='blue'><b>prentice</b></font>).  And so they go on,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) wrath rising with the recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) wrongs, <div class="bookquote">`so they go on;
and, if they'd got money enough -LRB-which it's a Providence they haven't,-RRB-
we shouldn't have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year
or two.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No more we should,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering
during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. <div class="bookquote">`Bill!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes.

<p/>The Jew nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the
fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) told to leave
the room.  Sikes shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) shoulders impatiently, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) thought
the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting
Miss Nancy to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) a jug of beer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You don't want any beer,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) arms, and retaining
her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) seat very composedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I tell you I do!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nonsense,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl coolly, <div class="bookquote">`Go on, Fagin.  I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s
going to say, Bill; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) needn't mind me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew still hesitated.  Sikes looked from one to the other in some
surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, you don't mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) asked at length.
<div class="bookquote">`You've known her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) long enough to trust her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), or the Devil's in it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
ain't one to blab.  Are you Nancy?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`_I_ should think not!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady:  drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair up
to the table, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) elbows upon it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, my dear, I know you're not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`but--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>and again
the old man paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But wot?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I didn't know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mightn't p`r`aps be out of sorts, you know,
my dear, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the other night,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.

<p/>At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing
a glass of brandy, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) head with an air of defiance, and burst
into sundry exclamations of <div class="bookquote">`Keep the game a-going!'   (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Never say die!'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the like.  These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both
gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head with a satisfied air, and
resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy with a laugh.  <div class="bookquote">`Tell Bill at once, about
Oliver!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ha! you're a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said
the Jew, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on the neck.  <div class="bookquote">`It WAS about Oliver I was going to
speak, sure enough.  Ha! ha! ha!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>demanded Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s the boy for you, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper;
laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) finger on the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) nose, and grinning frightfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed. Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Have him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy.  <div class="bookquote">`I would, if I was in your place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)
mayn't be so much up, as any of the others; but that's not what you
want, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'s only to open a door for you.  Depend upon it he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'s a safe
one, Bill.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>rejoined Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s been in good training these last
few weeks, and it's time he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) began to work for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) bread.  Besides, the
others are all too big.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) is just the size I want,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>interposed the Jew;
<div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) can't help himself.  That is, if you frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) enough.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>echoed Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`It'll be no sham frightening, mind you.
If there's anything queer about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) when we once get into the work; in
for a penny, in for a pound.  You won't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) alive again, Fagin.
Think of that, before you send him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>).  Mark my words!'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>said the robber,
poising a crowbar, which he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) had drawn from under the bedstead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I've thought of it all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew with energy. `I've--I've had my
eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), my dears, close--close. Once let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is one
of us; once fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) mind with the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) has been a thief; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)'s ours!  Ours for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) life.  Oho!  It couldn't have come about
better!  The old man crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast; and, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ours!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Yours, you mean.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps I do, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. <div class="bookquote">`Mine, if
you like, Bill.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And wot,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) agreeable friend, <div class="bookquote">`wot
makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know
there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you
might pick and choose from?'

 (<font color='red'><b>friend wot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Because they're of no use to me, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, with some
confusion, <div class="bookquote">`not worth the taking.  Their looks convict 'em when they
get into trouble, and I lose 'em all.  With this boy, properly managed,
my dears, I could do what I couldn't with twenty of them.  Besides,'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) self-possession, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) has us now if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
could only give us leg-bail again; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) must be in the same boat with
us.  Never mind how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) came there; it's quite enough for my power over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was in a robbery; that's all I want.  Now, how much better
this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the
way--which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`When is it to be done?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent
exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) received Fagin's affectation of humanity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, to be sure,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`when is it to be done, Bill?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes in a
surly voice, <div class="bookquote">`if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Good,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`there's no moon.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>asked the Jew.

<p/>Sikes nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And about--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, ah, it's all planned,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`Never
mind particulars.  You'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night.  I
shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak.  Then you hold your
tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that's all you'll have to
do.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was
decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew's next evening when the
night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>); Fagin craftily
observing, that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) evinced any disinclination to the task, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) would
be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) behalf, than anybody else.  It was also solemnly arranged that poor
Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be
unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes;
and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) thought
fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or
evil that might be necessary to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>): it being understood that, to
render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by
Mr. Sikes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) return should be required to be confirmed and
corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash
Toby Crackit.

<p/>These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a
furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner;
yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song,
mingled with wild execrations.  At length, in a fit of professional
enthusiasm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) insisted upon producing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) box of housebreaking tools:
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of
explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it
contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) fell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Good-night, Nancy,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Good-night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), narrowly.  There was no
flinching about the girl.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was as true and earnest in the matter as
Toby Crackit himself could be.

<p/>The Jew again bade her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the
prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back was turned, groped
downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Always the way!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>muttered the Jew to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) turned homeward.
<div class="bookquote">`The worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call
up some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never
lasts.  Ha! ha!  The man against the child, for a bag of gold!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) way, through mud and mire, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) gloomy abode:  where the Dodger
was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is Oliver a-bed?  I want to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) first remark as
they descended the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hours ago,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger, throwing open a door.  <div class="bookquote">`Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) is!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale
with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prison, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in
the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle
spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the
world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning softly away.  <div class="bookquote">`To-morrow. To-morrow.'



 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XX

<p/>WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES

<p/>When Oliver awoke in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was a good deal surprised to find
that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bedside; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) old shoes had been removed. At first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was
pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sitting
down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), in a tone and
manner which increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) alarm, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was to be taken to the
residence of Bill Sikes that night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`To--to--stop there, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>asked Oliver, anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, my dear.  Not to stop there,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`We shouldn't
like to lose you.  Don't be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us
again.  Ha! ha! ha!  We won't be so cruel as to send you away, my dear.
Oh no, no!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread,
looked round as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would still be very glad to get away if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I suppose,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes on Oliver, <div class="bookquote">`you want to know
what you're going to Bill's for--eh, my dear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been
reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did want to know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, do you think?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>inquired Fagin, parrying the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Indeed I don't know, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from
a close perusal of the boy's face.  <div class="bookquote">`Wait till Bill tells you, then.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver's not expressing any greater
curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt
very anxious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was too much confused by the earnest cunning of
Fagin's looks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own speculations, to make any further inquiries
just then.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had no other opportunity:  for the Jew remained very
surly and silent till night:  when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) prepared to go abroad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You may burn a candle,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, putting one upon the table.
<div class="bookquote">`And here's a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.
Good-night!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Good-night!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, softly.

<p/>The Jew walked to the door: looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) shoulder at the boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
went.  Suddenly stopping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) name.

<p/>Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to
light it.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did so; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) placed the candlestick upon the table,
saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), with lowering and
contracted brows, from the dark end of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Take heed, Oliver! take heed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) right
hand before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in a warning manner.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'s a rough man, and thinks
nothing of blood when his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing;
and do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bids you.  Mind!'   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Placing a strong emphasis on the last
word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) suffered his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) features gradually to resolve themselves into a
ghastly grin, and, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, left the room.

<p/>Oliver leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand when the old man disappeared, and
pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had just heard.  The
more he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thought of the Jew's admonition, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was at a loss to
divine its real purpose and meaning.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) to Sikes,
which would not be equally well answered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) remaining with Fagin;
and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had been
selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker,
until another boy, better suited for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) purpose could be engaged.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remained
lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed
the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>),
began to read.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) turned over the leaves.  Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a
passage which attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) attention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) soon became intent upon the
volume.  It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals;
and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use. Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) read of
dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that
had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye
of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as
they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so
maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had
confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.
Here, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night,
had been tempted -LRB-so they said-RRB- and led on, by their own bad thoughts,
to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs
quail, to think of.  The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid,
that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon
them, to be sounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow
murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.

<p/>In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
Then, falling upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prayed Heaven to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from such
deeds; and rather to will that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should die at once, than be reserved
for crimes, so fearful and appalling. By degrees, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grew more calm,
and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might be rescued from
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a
poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it
might come to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) now, when, desolate and deserted, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood alone in
the midst of wickedness and guilt.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prayer, but still remained with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head buried in
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, when a rustling noise aroused him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's that!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure
standing by the door.  <div class="bookquote">`Who's there?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Me.  Only me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied a tremulous voice.

<p/>Oliver raised the candle above his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head: and looked towards the door.
It was Nancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Put down the light,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`It hurts
my eyes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very pale, and gently inquired if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were ill.
The girl threw herself into a chair, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>):  and
wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands; but made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`God forgive me!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried after a while, <div class="bookquote">`I never thought of this.'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Has anything happened?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>asked Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`Can I help you?  I will if I
can.  I will, indeed.'

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rocked herself to and fro; caught her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throat; and, uttering a
gurgling sound, gasped for breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nancy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, <div class="bookquote">`What is it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl beat her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet upon the ground;
and, suddenly stopping, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shawl close round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): and shivered
with cold.

<p/>Oliver stirred the fire.  Drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chair close to it, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat there,
for a little time, without speaking; but at length she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head,
and looked round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know what comes over me sometimes,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), affecting to
busy herself in arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dress; <div class="bookquote">`it's this damp dirty room, I
think.  Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Am I to go with you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>asked Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes.  I have come from Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`You are to go with
me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What for?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>asked Oliver, recoiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What for?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>echoed the girl, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes, and averting them again,
the moment they encountered the boy's face.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh!  For no harm.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't believe it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver:  who had watched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) closely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Have it your own way,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. <div class="bookquote">`For no
good, then.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had some power over the girl's better
feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) compassion
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) helpless state.  But, then, the thought darted across his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind
that it was barely eleven o'clock; and that many people were still in
the streets:  of whom surely some might be found to give credence to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) tale.  As the reflection occured to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stepped forward:  and
said, somewhat hastily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was ready.

<p/>Neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
companion.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) narrowly, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke; and cast upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a
look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) guessed what
had been passing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, stooping over him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and pointing to the door as
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked cautiously round.  <div class="bookquote">`You can't help yourself. I have tried
hard for you, but all to no purpose.  You are hedged round and round.
If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Struck by the energy of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manner, Oliver looked up in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face with
great surprise.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to speak the truth; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) countenance was
white and agitated; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) trembled with very earnestness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do
now,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued the girl aloud; <div class="bookquote">`for those who would have fetched you,
if I had not, would have been far more rough than me.  I have promised
for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm
to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death.  See here!  I have
borne all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neck and arms; and
continued, with great rapidity:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Remember this!  And don't let me suffer more for you, just now. If I
could help you, I would; but I have not the power.  They don't mean to
harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours.  Hush!
Every word from you is a blow for me.  Give me your hand.  Make haste!
Your hand!'

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and,
blowing out the light, drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up the stairs. The door was
opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as
quickly closed, when they had passed out.  A hackney-cabriolet was in
waiting; with the same vehemence which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had exhibited in addressing
Oliver, the girl pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and drew the curtains close.
The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) horse into full speed,
without the delay of an instant.

<p/>The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ear, the warnings and assurances she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had already imparted.  All was
so quick and hurried, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had scarcely time to recollect where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
was, or how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to
which the Jew's steps had been directed on the previous evening.

<p/>For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty
street, and a cry for help hung upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lips.  But the girl's voice
was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ear, beseeching him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in such tones of agony to remember her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had not the heart to utter it. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hesitated, the
opportunity was gone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was already in the house, and the door was
shut.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This way,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, releasing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hold for the first time.
<div class="bookquote">`Bill!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hallo!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a
candle.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh!  That's the time of day.  Come on!'

 (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty
welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes' temperament.  Nancy, appearing
much gratified thereby, saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) cordially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bull's-eye's gone home with Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>observed Sikes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lighted them
up.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'d have been in the way.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That's right,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>rejoined Nancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So you've got the kid,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes when they had all reached the room:
closing the door as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) come quiet?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Like a lamb,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>rejoined Nancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm glad to hear it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; `for the
sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) young carcase:  as would otherways have suffered for it.
Come here, young <div class="bookquote">`un; and let me read you a lectur' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>, which is as well
got over at once.'

<p/>Thus addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver's cap and
threw it into a corner; and then, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) by the shoulder, sat
himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, first:  do you know wot this is?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes, taking up a
pocket-pistol which lay on the table.

<p/>Oliver replied in the affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, then, look here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>continued Sikes.  `This is powder; that <div class="bookquote">`ere's
a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin' (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>.'

<p/>Oliver murmured his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) comprehension of the different bodies referred to;
and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and
deliberation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now it's loaded,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, I see it is, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>said the robber, grasping Oliver's wrist, and putting the
barrel so close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) temple that they touched; at which moment the
boy could not repress a start; <div class="bookquote">`if you speak a word when you're out
o'doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in
your head without notice.  So, if you _do_ make up your mind to speak
without leave, say your prayers first.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase
its effect, Mr. Sikes continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`As near as I know, there isn't anybody as would be asking very
partickler arter you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I needn't take this
devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn't for
your own good.  D'ye hear me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The short and the long of what you mean,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy:  speaking very
emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
serious attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) words:  <div class="bookquote">`is, that if you're crossed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in
this job you have on hand, you'll prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ever telling tales
afterwards, by shooting him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) through the head, and will take your chance
of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way
of business, every month of your life.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That's it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; <div class="bookquote">`women can always put
things in fewest words.--Except when it's blowing up; and then they
lengthens it out.  And now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s thoroughly up to it, let's have
some supper, and get a snooze before starting.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth;
disappearing for a few minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) presently returned with a pot of
porter and a dish of sheep's heads: which gave occasion to several
pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular
coincidence of <div class="bookquote">`jemmies'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>being a can name, common to them, and also to
an ingenious implement much used in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) profession.  Indeed, the worthy
gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on
active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof,
it may be here remarked, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) humourously drank all the beer at a
draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than
four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal.

<p/>Supper being ended--it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great
appetite for it--Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits
and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many
imprecations in case of failure, to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) at five precisely.  Oliver
stretched himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clothes, by command of the same authority, on
a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before
it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.

<p/>For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy
might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the
girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to
trim the light.  Weary with watching and anxiety, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) at length fell
asleep.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was
thrusting various articles into the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) great-coat, which
hung over the back of a chair.  Nancy was busily engaged in preparing
breakfast.  It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning,
and it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against
the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, then!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; <div class="bookquote">`half-past five!
Look sharp, or you'll get no breakfast; for it's late as it is.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver was not long in making his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) toilet; having taken some breakfast,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was quite
ready.

<p/>Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) a handkerchief to tie
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) throat; Sikes gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) a large rough cape to button over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
shoulders.  Thus attired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand to the robber, who, merely
pausing to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) with a menacing gesture that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had that same
pistol in a side-pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) great-coat, clasped it firmly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>),
and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) away.

<p/>Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope
of meeting a look from the girl.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) old seat in
front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.



<p/>CHAPTER XXI

<p/>THE EXPEDITION

<p/>It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and
raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy.  The night had
been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the
kennels were overflowing.  There was a faint glimmering of the coming
day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the
scene:  the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street
lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the
wet house-tops, and dreary streets.  There appeared to be nobody
stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were
all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were
noiseless and empty.

<p/>By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had
fairly begun to break.  Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a
few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and
then, a stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver
bestowing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner
who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) time.  The
public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open.  By
degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people
were met with.  Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to
their work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads;
donkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock
or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken
concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern
suburbs of the town.  As they approached the City, the noise and
traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between
Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and
bustle.  It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on
again, and the busy morning of half the London population had begun.

<p/>Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square,
Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into
Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a
tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.

<p/>It was market-morning.  The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with
filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking
bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest
upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above.  All the pens in the centre
of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into
the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the
gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep.
Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and
vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the
whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of
the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs,
the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides;
the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every
public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and
yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every
corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty
figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the
throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite
confounded the senses.

<p/>Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), elbowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) way through the
thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the
numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nodded,
twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many
invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they
were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane
into Holborn.

<p/>`Now, young <div class="bookquote">`un!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew's
Church, <div class="bookquote">`hard upon seven! you must step out.  Come, don't lag behind
already, Lazy-legs!'

 (<font color='red'><b>St. Andrew</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) little companion's
wrist; Oliver, quickening his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pace into a kind of trot between a fast
walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as
well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could.

<p/>They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park
corner, and were on their way to Kensington:  when Sikes relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind,
came up.  Seeing <div class="bookquote">`Hounslow'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>written on it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) asked the driver with as
much civility as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) could assume, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) would give them a lift as far
as Isleworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Jump up,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.  <div class="bookquote">`Is that your boy?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s my boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Your father walks rather too quick for you, don't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), my man?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, interposing.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s used to it.

<p/>Here, take hold of my hand, Ned.  In with you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus addressing Oliver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) into the cart; and the driver,
pointing to a heap of sacks, told him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) to lie down there, and rest
himself.

<p/>As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and
more, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) companion meant to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  Kensington, Hammersmith,
Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on
as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey.  At length,
they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way
beyond which, another road appeared to run off.  And here, the cart
stopped.

<p/>Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand
all the while; and lifting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) down directly, bestowed a furious look
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), and rapped the side-pocket with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) fist, in a significant
manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Good-bye, boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s sulky,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) a shake; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s sulky.  A young
dog!  Don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not I!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined the other, getting into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) cart.  <div class="bookquote">`It's a fine day,
after all.'   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) drove away.

<p/>Sikes waited until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
might look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) wanted, once again led him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) onward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
journey.

<p/>They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and
then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many
large gardens and gentlemen's houses on both sides of the way, and
stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town.
Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large
letters, <div class="bookquote">`Hampton.'   (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>They lingered about, in the fields, for some
hours.  At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an
old public-house with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the
kitchen fire.

<p/>The kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the
middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the
fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking
and smoking.  They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes;
and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) young comrade
sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their
company.

<p/>They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr.
Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to
feel quite certain they were not going any further.  Being much tired
with the walk, and getting up so early, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) dozed a little at first;
then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell
asleep.

<p/>It was quite dark when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was awakened by a push from Sikes. Rousing
himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) found that worthy
in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint
of ale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So, you're going on to Lower Halliford, are you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, who seemed a little the worse--or better,
as the case might be--for drinking; <div class="bookquote">`and not slow about it neither.  My
horse hasn't got a load behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) going back, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had coming up in
the mornin' (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) won't be long a-doing of it.  Here's luck to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).
Ecod! he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s a good <div class="bookquote">`un!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>demanded Sikes,
pushing the ale towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) new friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If you're going directly, I can,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, looking out of the
pot.  <div class="bookquote">`Are you going to Halliford?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Going on to Shepperton,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm your man, as far as I go,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other.  <div class="bookquote">`Is all paid,
Becky?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, the other gentleman's paid,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I say!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the man, with tipsy gravity; <div class="bookquote">`that won't do, you know.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`You're a-going to accommodate us, and
wot's to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?'

 (<font color='red'><b>The stranger fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face;
having done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) seized Sikes by the hand:  and declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was a
real good fellow.  To which Mr. Sikes replied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was joking; as, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
had been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was.

<p/>After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company
good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as
they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands full, to see
the party start.

<p/>The horse, whose health had been drunk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) absence, was standing
outside:  ready harnessed to the cart.  Oliver and Sikes got in without
any further ceremony; and the man to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belonged, having lingered
for a minute or two <div class="bookquote">`to bear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and to defy the hostler and the
world to produce his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) equal, mounted also.  Then, the hostler was told
to give the horse his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head; and, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head being given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made a
very unpleasant use of it:  tossing it into the air with great disdain,
and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing
those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hind-legs,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right
gallantly.

<p/>The night was very dark.  A damp mist rose from the river, and the
marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields.  It was
piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken;
for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
into conversation.  Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the
cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange
objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as
if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.

<p/>As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven.  There was a
light in the ferry-house window opposite:  which streamed across the
road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves
beneath it.  There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and
the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind.  It seemed
like quiet music for the repose of the dead.

<p/>Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road.
Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped.  Sikes alighted, took
Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.

<p/>They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected;
but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes
and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights
of a town at no great distance.  On looking intently forward, Oliver
saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to
the foot of a bridge.

<p/>Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then
turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The water!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>thought Oliver, turning sick with fear.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) has brought
me to this lonely place to murder me!'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) young life, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) saw that they stood before a solitary house:
all ruinous and decayed.  There was a window on each side of the
dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible.
The house was dark, dismantled: and the all appearance, uninhabited.

<p/>Sikes, with Oliver's hand still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), softly approached the low
porch, and raised the latch.  The door yielded to the pressure, and
they passed in together.



<p/>CHAPTER XXII

<p/>THE BURGLARY

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hallo!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the
passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't make such a row,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, bolting the door.  <div class="bookquote">`Show a glim,
Toby.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Aha! my pal!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the same voice.  <div class="bookquote">`A glim, Barney, a glim! Show the
gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the
person he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) addressed, to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) slumbers:  for the noise of
a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct
muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you hear?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the same voice.  <div class="bookquote">`There's Bill Sikes in the
passage with nobody to do the civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>); and you sleeping there, as
if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger.  Are you
any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you
thoroughly?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the
room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on
the right hand; first, a feeble candle:  and next, the form of the same
individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the
infirmity of speaking through his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) nose, and officiating as waiter at
the public-house on Saffron Hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bister Sikes!'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; <div class="bookquote">`cub
id, sir; cub id.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Here! you get on first,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">`Quicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Muttering a curse upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>);
and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken
chairs, a table, and a very old couch:  on which, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) legs much
higher than his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long
clay pipe.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with
large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring,
shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches.  Mr. Crackit -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) it
was-RRB- had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) head or face;
but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew
curls, through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers,
ornamented with large common rings.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) was a trifle above the middle
size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by
no means detracted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) own admiration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) top-boots, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>)
contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bill, my boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said this figure, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) head towards the door,
<div class="bookquote">`I'm glad to see you.  I was almost afraid you'd given it up:  in which
case I should have made a personal wentur.  Hallo!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) eyes
rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting
posture, and demanded who that was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The boy.  Only the boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the
fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Wud of Bister Fagid's lads,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Barney, with a grin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Fagin's, eh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`Wot an inwalable
boy that'll make, for the old ladies'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pockets in chapels!  His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mug is a
fortin' to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There--there's enough of that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>interposed Sikes, impatiently; and
stooping over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) recumbant friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) whispered a few words in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
ear:  at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with
a long stare of astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) seat, <div class="bookquote">`if you'll give us something
to eat and drink while we're waiting, you'll put some heart in us; or
in me, at all events.  Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest
yourself; for you'll have to go out with us again to-night, though not
very far off.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool
to the fire, sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) aching head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands, scarecely knowing
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was, or what was passing around him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and
a bottle upon the table,  <div class="bookquote">`Success to the crack!'   (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) rose to honour
the toast; and, carefully depositing his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) empty pipe in a corner,
advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its
contents.  Mr. Sikes did the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A drain for the boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. <div class="bookquote">`Down with
it, innocence.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man's face;
<div class="bookquote">`indeed, I--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Down with it!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>echoed Toby.  <div class="bookquote">`Do you think I don't know what's good
for you?  Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) to drink it, Bill.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) had better!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">`Burn my
body, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) isn't more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers.  Drink
it, you perwerse imp; drink it!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily
swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a
violent fit of coughing:  which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and
even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.

<p/>This done, and Sikes having satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) appetite -LRB-Oliver could eat
nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) swallow-RRB-, the
two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap.  Oliver
retained his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched
himself on the floor:  close outside the fender.

<p/>They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but
Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. Oliver fell
into a heavy doze:  imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes,
or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other
of the scenes of the past day:  when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was roused by Toby Crackit
jumping up and declaring it was half-past one.

<p/>In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively
engaged in busy preparation.  Sikes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) companion enveloped their
necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats;
Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>)
hastily crammed into the pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Barkers for me, Barney,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Toby Crackit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Here they are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. <div class="bookquote">`You
loaded them yourself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`All right!'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>replied Toby, stowing them away.  <div class="bookquote">`The persuaders?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I've got 'em,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies--nothing forgotten?'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>inquired Toby:
fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`All right,'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>rejoined his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) companion.  <div class="bookquote">`Bring them bits of timber,
Barney.  That's the time of day.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) took a thick stick from Barney's hands, who,
having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on
Oliver's cape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now then!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Oliver:  who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the
air, and the drink which had been forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>):  put his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand
mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Take his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) other hand, Toby,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Look out, Barney.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet.
The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having
made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.

<p/>It was now intensely dark.  The fog was much heavier than it had been
in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that,
although no rain fell, Oliver's hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes
after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture
that was floating about.  They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards
the lights which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had seen before.  They were at no great distance
off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Slap through the town,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>whispered Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`there'll be nobody in the
way, to-night, to see us.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little
town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted.  A dim light shone
at intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs
occasionally broke the silence of the night.  But there was nobody
abroad.  They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two.

<p/>Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After
walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house
surrounded by a wall:  to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely
pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The boy next,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Toby.  <div class="bookquote">`Hoist him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) up; I'll catch hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) under the
arms; and in three or four seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) and Toby were lying on the grass
on the other side.  Sikes followed directly.  And they stole cautiously
towards the house.

<p/>And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and
terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the
objects of the expedition.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands together, and
involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror.  A mist came
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ashy face; his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) limbs
failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sank upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Get up!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pocket; <div class="bookquote">`Get up, or I'll strew your brains upon the grass.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! for God's sake let me go!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver; <div class="bookquote">`let me run away and die
in the fields.  I will never come near London; never, never!  Oh! pray
have mercy on me, and do not make me steal.  For the love of all the
bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had
cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) grasp, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)
hand upon the boy's mouth, and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) to the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the man; <div class="bookquote">`it won't answer here.  Say another word, and
I'll do your business myself with a crack on the head.  That makes no
noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel.  Here, Bill, wrench
the shutter open.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'s game enough now, I'll engage.  I've seen older
hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold
night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin's head for sending
Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little
noise.  After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) had referred, swung open on its hinges.

<p/>It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the
ground, at the back of the house:  which belonged to a scullery, or
small brewing-place, at the end of the passage.  The aperture was so
small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to
defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of
Oliver's size, nevertheless.  A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike's art,
sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood
wide open also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now listen, you young limb,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver's face; <div class="bookquote">`I'm a
going to put you through there.  Take this light; go softly up the
steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street
door; unfasten it, and let us in.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`There's a bolt at the top, you won't be able to reach,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>interposed
Toby. <div class="bookquote">`Stand upon one of the hall chairs.  There are three there, Bill,
with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on 'em:  which is
the old lady's arms.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Keep quiet, can't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, with a threatening look. <div class="bookquote">`The
room-door is open, is it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Wide,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. `The game of
that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog,
who's got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) feels
wakeful.  Ha! ha! Barney <div class="bookquote">`ticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) away to-night.  So neat!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div><p/>Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed
without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to be silent, and to get
to work.  Toby complied, by first producing his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) lantern, and placing it
on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) head against
the wall beneath the window, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) knees, so as to
make a step of his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) back. This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), put Oliver gently through the window with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feet first;
and, without leaving hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) collar, planted him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) safely on the
floor inside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Take this lantern,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, looking into the room.  <div class="bookquote">`You see the
stairs afore you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, <div class="bookquote">`Yes.'   (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Sikes, pointing to
the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to take
notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was within shot all the way; and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) faltered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
would fall dead that instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's done in a minute,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, in the same low whisper. <div class="bookquote">`Directly
I leave go of you, do your work.  Hark!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>whispered the other man.

<p/>They listened intently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, releasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hold of Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`Now!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In the short time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had had to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) senses, the boy had firmly
resolved that, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) died in the attempt or not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) would make one
effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family.  Filled
with this idea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) advanced at once, but stealthily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come back!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>suddenly cried Sikes aloud.  <div class="bookquote">`Back! back!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and
by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lantern fall, and knew
not whether to advance or fly.

<p/>The cry was repeated--a light appeared--a vision of two terrified
half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes--a
flash--a loud noise--a smoke--a crash somewhere, but where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew
not,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) staggered back.

<p/>Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was up again, and had him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
by the collar before the smoke had cleared away.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) fired his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) own
pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy
up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Clasp your arm tighter,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) through the
window.  <div class="bookquote">`Give me a shawl here.  They've hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).  Quick!  How the boy
bleeds!'

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of
fire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried
over uneven ground at a rapid pace.  And then, the noises grew confused
in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy's heart;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw or heard no more.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIII

<p/>WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR.
BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON
SOME POINTS

<p/>The night was bitter cold.  The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a
hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways
and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad:  which,
as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it
savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies,
scattered it in air.  Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night
for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God
they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
down and die.  Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare
streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may,
can hardly open them in a more bitter world.

<p/>Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the
matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already
introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a
cheerful fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) own little room, and glanced, with no small degree
of complacency, at a small round table:  on which stood a tray of
corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most
grateful meal that matrons enjoy.  In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to
solace herself with a cup of tea. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) glanced from the table to the
fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a
small song in a small voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) inward satisfaction evidently
increased,--so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) elbow on the table, and looking
reflectively at the fire; <div class="bookquote">`I'm sure we have all on us a great deal to
be grateful for!  A great deal, if we did but know it.  Ah!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Corney shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) head mournfully, as if deploring the mental
blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver
spoon -LRB-private property-RRB- into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin
tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.

<p/>How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds!  The
black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs.
Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney's
hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Drat the pot!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron thing</b></font>)</div>said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on
the hob; <div class="bookquote">`a little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups!
What use is it of, to anybody!  Except,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron thing</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney, pausing,
<div class="bookquote">`except to a poor desolate creature like me.  Oh dear!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, the matron dropped into her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) chair, and, once more
resting her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) elbow on the table, thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) solitary fate.  The
small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) mind sad
recollections of Mr. Corney -LRB-who had not been dead more than
five-and-twenty years-RRB-; and she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was overpowered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I shall never get another!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; <div class="bookquote">`I shall
never get another--like him (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div><p/>Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is
uncertain.  It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) spoke; and took it up afterwards.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) had just tasted her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) first
cup, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, come in with you!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney, sharply.  <div class="bookquote">`Some of the old
women dying, I suppose.  They always die when I'm at meals. Don't stand
there, letting the cold air in, don't.  What's amiss now, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing, ma'am, nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>replied a man's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Dear me!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, <div class="bookquote">`is that Mr.
Bumble?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`At your service, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping
outside to rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) coat; and
who now made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a
bundle in the other.  <div class="bookquote">`Shall I shut the door, ma'am?'

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any
impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors.
Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold
himself, shut it without permission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hard, indeed, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle.  <div class="bookquote">`Anti-porochial weather
this, ma'am.  We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a
matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very
blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course not.  When would they be, Mr. Bumble?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron,
sipping her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`When, indeed, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`Why here's one man that,
in consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and
a good pound of cheese, full weight.  Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grateful, ma'am?  Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
grateful?  Not a copper farthing's worth of it!  What does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do,
ma'am, but ask for a few coals; if it's only a pocket handkerchief
full, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says!  Coals! What would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do with coals?  Toast his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheese
with 'em and then come back for more.  That's the way with these
people, ma'am; give 'em a apron full of coals to-day, and they'll come
back for another, the day after to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The matron</b></font>)</div><p/>The matron expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) entire concurrence in this intelligible
simile; and the beadle went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I never,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`see anything like the pitch it's got to.
The day afore yesterday, a man--you have been a married woman, ma'am,
and I may mention it to you--a man, with hardly a rag upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back
-LRB-here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor-RRB-, goes to our overseer's door
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has got company coming to dinner; and says, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be
relieved, Mrs. Corney.  As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't go away, and shocked the company
very much, our overseer sent him (<font color='blue'><b>overseer</b></font>) out a pound of potatoes and half a
pint of oatmeal.  ``My heart!'' says the ungrateful villain, ``what's the
use of _this_ to me?  You might as well give me a pair of iron
spectacles!''  ``Very good,'' says our overseer, taking 'em away again,
``you won't get anything else here.''  ``Then I'll die in the streets!''
says the vagrant.  ``Oh no, you won't,'' says our overseer.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ha! ha!  That was very good!  So like Mr. Grannett, wasn't it?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>interposed the matron.  <div class="bookquote">`Well, Mr. Bumble?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>rejoined the beadle, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) went away; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) _did_ die in
the streets.  There's a obstinate pauper for you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It beats anything I could have believed,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>observed the matron
emphatically.  <div class="bookquote">`But don't you think out-of-door relief a very bad
thing, any way, Mr. Bumble?  You're a gentleman of experience, and
ought to know.  Come.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Corney,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious
of superior information, <div class="bookquote">`out-of-door relief, properly managed:
properly managed, ma'am: is the porochial safeguard.  The great
principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what
they don't want; and then they get tired of coming.'

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Dear me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Corney.  <div class="bookquote">`Well, that is a good one, too!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes.  Betwixt you and me, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`that's the
great principle; and that's the reason why, if you look at any cases
that get into them owdacious newspapers, you'll always observe that
sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese.  That's the
rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But, however,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the
beadle, stopping to unpack his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) bundle, <div class="bookquote">`these are official secrets,
ma'am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial
officers, such as ourselves. This is the port wine, ma'am, that the
board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only
out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle secrets</b></font>)</div><p/>Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to
test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of
drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it
carefully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) pocket; and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat, as if to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You'll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It blows, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) coat-collar,
<div class="bookquote">`enough to cut one's ears off.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was
moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to
bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) good-night, bashfully inquired whether--whether he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) wouldn't
take a cup of tea?

<p/>Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) collar again; laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat
and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table.  As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
slowly seated himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) looked at the lady.  She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes upon
the little teapot.  Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.

<p/>Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>)
sat down, her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) tea.  Again
Mr. Bumble coughed--louder this time than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had coughed yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Sweet?  Mr. Bumble?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Very sweet, indeed, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes on
Mrs. Corney as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr.
Bumble was that beadle at that moment.

<p/>The tea was made, and handed in silence.  Mr. Bumble, having spread a
handkerchief over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the
splendour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these
amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had
no injurious effect upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) appetite, but, on the contrary, rather
seemed to facilitate his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) operations in the tea and toast department.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You have a cat, ma'am, I see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who,
in the centre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) family, was basking before the fire; <div class="bookquote">`and kittens
too, I declare!'

 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can't think,'  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>replied the
matron.  <div class="bookquote">`They're _so_ happy, _so_ frolicsome, and _so_ cheerful, that
they are quite companions for me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Very nice animals, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; <div class="bookquote">`so very
domestic.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; <div class="bookquote">`so fond of their home
too, that it's quite a pleasure, I'm sure.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Corney, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) teaspoon, <div class="bookquote">`I mean to say this, ma'am; that any cat, or kitten,
that could live with you, ma'am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be
a ass, ma'am.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, Mr. Bumble!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Mrs. Corney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's of no use disguising facts, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, slowly
flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
doubly impressive; <div class="bookquote">`I would drown it myself, with pleasure.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then you're a cruel man,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron man</b></font>)</div>said the matron vivaciously, as she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) held out
her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) hand for the beadle's cup; <div class="bookquote">`and a very hard-hearted man besides.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hard-hearted, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`Hard?'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bumble resigned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney's little finger as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) laced
waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chair a very little
morsel farther from the fire.

<p/>It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been
sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and
fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from
the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance
between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers
will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great
heroism on Mr. Bumble's part:  he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) being in some sort tempted by time,
place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings,
which however well they may become the lips of the light and
thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the
land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other
great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the
stateliness and gravity of a beadle:  who -LRB-as is well known-RRB- should be
the sternest and most inflexible among them all.

<p/>Whatever were Mr. Bumble's intentions, however -LRB-and no doubt they were
of the best-RRB-: it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before
remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble,
moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the
distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel
round the outer edge of the circle, brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chair, in time, close
to that in which the matron was seated.

<p/>Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble
stopped.

<p/>Now, if the matron had moved her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) chair to the right, she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) would have
been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) must have fallen
into Mr. Bumble's arms; so -LRB-being a discreet matron, and no doubt
foreseeing these consequences at a glance-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) remained where she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was,
and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, stirring his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) tea, and
looking up into the matron's face; <div class="bookquote">`are _you_ hard-hearted, Mrs.
Corney?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Dear me!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron question</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the matron, <div class="bookquote">`what a very curious question from a
single man.  What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron question</b></font>)</div><p/>The beadle drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast;
whisked the crumbs off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) knees; wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lips; and deliberately
kissed the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mr. Bumble!'  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was
so great, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had quite lost her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Bumble, I shall
scream!'   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner,
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) arm round the matron's waist.

<p/>As the lady had stated her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) intention of screaming, of course she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would
have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was
rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door:  which was no
sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine
bottles, and began dusting them with great violence:  while the matron
sharply demanded who was there.

<p/>It is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy
of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) voice had quite recovered all its official asperity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If you please, mistress,'  (<font color='red'><b>a pauper</b></font>)</div>said a withered old female pauper, hideously
ugly:  putting her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) head in at the door, <div class="bookquote">`Old Sally is a-going fast.'

 (<font color='red'><b>a pauper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, what's that to me?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>angrily demanded the matron.  <div class="bookquote">`I can't keep
her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) alive, can I?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, mistress,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the old woman, <div class="bookquote">`nobody can; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s far
beyond the reach of help.  I've seen a many people die; little babes
and great strong men; and I know when death's a-coming, well enough.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s troubled in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind: and when the fits are not on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--and
that's not often, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is dying very hard,--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has got
something to tell, which you must hear.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll never die quiet till
you come, mistress.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of
invectives against old women who couldn't even die without purposely
annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>)
came back, lest anything particular should occur.  Bidding the
messenger walk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>)
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way.

<p/>Mr. Bumble's conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs,
closely inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the
genuine metal, and, having satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) curiosity on these points, put
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four
distinct times round the table.

<p/>Having gone through this very extraordinary performance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) took off
the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact
inventory of the furniture.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIV

<p/>TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT.  BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF
IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY

<p/>It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the
matron's room.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) body was bent by age; her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) limbs trembled with
palsy; her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the
grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature's hand.

<p/>Alas!  How few of Nature's faces are left alone to gladden us with
their beauty!  The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world,
change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions
sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass
off, and leave Heaven's surface clear.  It is a common thing for the
countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to
subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and
settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they
grow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by
the coffin's side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth.

<p/>The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering
some indistinct answers to the chidings of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) companion; being at
length compelled to pause for breath, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) gave the light into her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hand,
and remained behind to follow as she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) might: while the more nimble
superior made her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) way to the room where the sick woman lay.

<p/>It was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end.
There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish
apothecary's apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick
out of a quill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Cold night, Mrs. Corney,'  (<font color='red'><b>this gentleman</b></font>)</div>said this young gentleman, as the matron
entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Very cold, indeed, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>replied the mistress, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) most civil
tones, and dropping a curtsey as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You should get better coals out of your contractors,'  (<font color='red'><b>the apothecary</b></font>)</div>said the
apothecary's deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the
rusty poker; <div class="bookquote">`these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>apothecary deputy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`They're the board's choosing, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>returned the matron. <div class="bookquote">`The least
they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm:  for our places are
hard enough.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the young mag, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) face towards the bed, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>)
had previously quite forgotten the patient, <div class="bookquote">`it's all U.P. there, Mrs.
Corney.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It is, is it, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>asked the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,'  (<font color='red'><b>the apothecary</b></font>)</div>said the
apothecary's apprentice, intent upon the toothpick's point. <div class="bookquote">`It's a
break-up of the system altogether.  Is she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) dozing, old lady?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the
affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)'ll go off in that way, if you don't make a row,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said
the young man.  <div class="bookquote">`Put the light on the floor.  She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) won't see it there.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The attendant</b></font>)</div><p/>The attendant did as she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was told:  shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) head meanwhile, to
intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time
returned.  The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped
herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed.

<p/>The apothecary's apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the
toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it
for ten minutes or so:  when apparently growing rather dull, he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wished
Mrs. Corney joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) job, and took himself off on tiptoe.

<p/>When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from
the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to
catch the heat.  The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled
faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position,
they began to converse in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?'  (<font color='red'><b>the messenger</b></font>)</div>inquired the

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a word,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other.  <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) plucked and tore at her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) arms for
a little time; but I held her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) soon dropped off.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>)
hasn't much strength in her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>), so I easily kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) quiet.  I ain't so
weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) drink the hot wine the doctor said she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) was to have?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>demanded
the first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I tried to get it down,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined the other.  <div class="bookquote">`But her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) teeth were
tight set, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I
could do to get it back again.  So I drank it; and it did me good!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the hags</b></font>)</div><p/>Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard,
the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I mind the time,'  (<font color='red'><b>the hags</b></font>)</div>said the first speaker, <div class="bookquote">`when she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) would have done
the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ay, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) would,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>rejoined the other; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) had a merry heart. <div class="bookquote">`A
many, many, beautiful corpses she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) laid out, as nice and neat as
waxwork.  My old eyes have seen them--ay, and those old hands touched
them too; for I have helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>), scores of times.'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Stretching forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) trembling fingers as she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) spoke, the old creature
shook them exultingly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) face, and fumbling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) pocket,
brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) shook
a few grains into the outstretched palm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) companion, and a few
more into her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) own.  While they were thus employed, the matron, who had
been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to
wait?

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not long, mistress,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the second woman, looking up into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
face.  <div class="bookquote">`We have none of us long to wait for Death.  Patience, patience!
He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)'ll be here soon enough for us all.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron sternly. <div class="bookquote">`You,
Martha, tell me; has she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) been in this way before?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Often,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>answered the first woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But will never be again,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added the second one; <div class="bookquote">`that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll never
wake again but once--and mind, mistress, that won't be for long!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Long or short,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron, snappishly, <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) won't find me here
when she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for
nothing.  It's no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house
die, and I won't--that's more. Mind that, you impudent old harridans.
If you make a fool of me again, I'll soon cure you, I warrant you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned
towards the bed, caused her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) to look round.  The patient had raised
herself upright, and was stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) arms towards them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Who's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) cried, in a hollow voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush, hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>said one of the women, stooping over her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`Lie down, lie
down!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll never lie down again alive!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, struggling. <div class="bookquote">`I
_will_ tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!  Come here!  Nearer!  Let me whisper in your ear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into a chair by the
bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) caught sight of
the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Turn them away,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, drowsily; <div class="bookquote">`make haste! make haste!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous
lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) best
friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the
door, and returned to the bedside.  On being excluded, the old ladies
changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was
drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a
moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was labouring
under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been
privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy
old ladies themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now listen to me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great
effort to revive one latent spark of energy.  <div class="bookquote">`In this very room--in
this very bed--I once nursed a pretty young creetur' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>, that was brought
into the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet cut and bruised with walking, and all
soiled with dust and blood.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave birth to a boy, and died.  Let me
think--what was the year again!'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Never mind the year,'  (<font color='red'><b>the auditor</b></font>)</div>said the impatient auditor; <div class="bookquote">`what about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the auditor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ay,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) former drowsy state,
<div class="bookquote">`what about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?--what about--I know!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, jumping fiercely up:
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face flushed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes starting from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head--'I robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
so I did!  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasn't cold--I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasn't cold, when I stole
it!'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stole what, for God's sake?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>cried the matron, with a gesture as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) would call for help.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`_It_!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>replied the woman, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand over the other's mouth. <div class="bookquote">`The
only thing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted clothes to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) warm, and food to
eat; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had kept it safe, and had it in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom.  It was gold, I
tell you!  Rich gold, that might have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Gold!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell
back.  <div class="bookquote">`Go on, go on--yes--what of it?  Who was the mother? When was
it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) charge me to keep it safe,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the woman with a groan, <div class="bookquote">`and
trusted me as the only woman about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).  I stole it in my heart when
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first showed it me hanging round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck; and the child's death,
perhaps, is on me besides!  They would have treated him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) better, if they
had known it all!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Known what?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the other.  <div class="bookquote">`Speak!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The boy grew so like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, rambling on, and not

face.  Poor girl! poor girl!  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so young, too! Such a gentle
lamb!  Wait; there's more to tell.  I have not told you all, have I?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied the matron, inclining her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) head to catch the words, as
they came more faintly from the dying woman.  <div class="bookquote">`Be quick, or it may be
too late!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, making a more violent effort than before;
<div class="bookquote">`the mother, when the pains of death first came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), whispered in
my ear that if her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come
when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother
named. ``And oh, kind Heaven!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thin hands
together, ``whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in
this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child,
abandoned to its mercy!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The boy's name?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>demanded the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`They _called_ him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the woman, feebly.  <div class="bookquote">`The gold I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, yes--what?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the other.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reply; but drew
back, instinctively, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a
sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered
some indistinct sounds in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.

<p/>*      *      *      *      *

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stone dead!'  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the
door was opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And nothing to tell, after all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>rejoined the matron, walking
carelessly away.

<p/>The two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the
preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left
alone, hovering about the body.



<p/>CHAPTER XXV

<p/>WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY

<p/>While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat
in the old den--the same from which Oliver had been removed by the
girl--brooding over a dull, smoky fire.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) held a pair of bellows upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knee, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it
into more cheerful action; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had fallen into deep thought; and
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arms folded on them, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) chin resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thumbs, fixed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars.

<p/>At a table behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and
Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy
against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling.  The countenance of the
first-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired
great additional interest from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) close observance of the game, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling's hand; upon which, from time to
time, as occasion served, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) bestowed a variety of earnest glances:
wisely regulating his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) own play by the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) observations upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) neighbour's cards.  It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hat,
as, indeed, was often his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) custom within doors.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) also sustained a
clay pipe between his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) teeth, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) only removed for a brief space
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot
upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the
accommodation of the company.

<p/>Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more
excitable nature than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) accomplished friend, it was observable that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover
indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a
scientific rubber.  Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close
attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master
Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) friend to
be <div class="bookquote">`blowed,'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>or to insert his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) head in a sack, or replying with some
other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application
of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling.
It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) partner invariably
lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates,
appeared to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) the highest amusement, inasmuch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) laughed
most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had
never seen such a jolly game in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) born days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's two doubles and the rub,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chitling, with a very long
face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) drew half-a-crown from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket.  <div class="bookquote">`I never see
such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything.  Even when we've good
cards, Charley and I can't make nothing of 'em.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very
ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) consequent shout of
laughter roused the Jew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) reverie, and induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) to inquire
what was the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Matter, Fagin!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>cried Charley.  <div class="bookquote">`I wish you had watched the play.
Tommy Chitling hasn't won a point; and I went partners with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) against
the Artfull and dumb.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ay, ay!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was at no loss to understand the reason. <div class="bookquote">`Try 'em again, Tom;
try 'em again.'

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>`No more of it for me, thank <div class="bookquote">`ee, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Chitling; `I've
had enough.  That <div class="bookquote">`ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there's no
standing again'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>).'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ha! ha! my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`you must get up very early in the
morning, to win against the Dodger.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Morning!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley Bates; <div class="bookquote">`you must put your boots on over-night,
and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your
shoulders, if you want to come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy,
and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first
picture-card, at a shilling at a time.  Nobody accepting the challenge,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pipe being by this time smoked out, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) proceeded to amuse
himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the
piece of chalk which had served him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in lieu of counters; whistling,
meantime, with peculiar shrillness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`How precious dull you are, Tommy!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger silence</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, stopping short
when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling.  <div class="bookquote">`What
do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>)'s thinking of, Fagin?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`How should I know, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, looking round as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
plied the bellows.  <div class="bookquote">`About his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) losses, maybe; or the little retirement
in the country that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)'s just left, eh?  Ha! ha!  Is that it, my dear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of
discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply.  <div class="bookquote">`What do _you_ say,
Charley?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`_I_ should say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div>replied Master Bates, with a grin, <div class="bookquote">`that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was
uncommon sweet upon Betsy.  See how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)'s a-blushing!  Oh, my eye!
here's a merry-go-rounder!  Tommy Chitling's in love!  Oh, Fagin,
Fagin! what a spree!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim
of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) chair
with such violence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) balance, and pitched over upon the
floor; where -LRB-the accident abating nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) merriment-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) lay at
full length until his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) laugh was over, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) former
position, and began another laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Never mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and
giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.
<div class="bookquote">`Betsy's a fine girl.  Stick up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>), Tom.  Stick up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What I mean to say, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the
face, <div class="bookquote">`is, that that isn't anything to anybody here.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No more it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`Charley will talk.  Don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>),
my dear; don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>).  Betsy's a fine girl.  Do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) bids you,
Tom, and you will make your fortune.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So I _do_ do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) bids me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Chitling; <div class="bookquote">`I shouldn't have
been milled, if it hadn't been for her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) advice.  But it turned out a
good job for you; didn't it, Fagin!  And what's six weeks of it?  It
must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when
you don't want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, to be sure, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You wouldn't mind it again, Tom, would you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>asked the Dodger, winking
upon Charley and the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`if Bet was all right?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I mean to say that I shouldn't,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Tom, angrily. <div class="bookquote">`There, now.
Ah!  Who'll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nobody, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`not a soul, Tom.  I don't know one
of 'em that would do it besides you; not one of 'em, my dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I might have got clear off, if I'd split upon her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>); mightn't I, Fagin?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the dupe</b></font>)</div>angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe.  <div class="bookquote">`A word from me would have
done it; wouldn't it, Fagin?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the dupe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`To be sure it would, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But I didn't blab it; did I, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div>demanded Tom, pouring question
upon question with great volubility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, to be sure,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`you were too stout-hearted for
that.  A deal too stout, my dear!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps I was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div>rejoined Tom, looking round; <div class="bookquote">`and if I was, what's to
laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened
to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the
company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender.  But,
unfortunately, Charley, in opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) mouth to reply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was never
more serious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a
violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary
ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender;
who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose
his (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old
gentleman, and caused him (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) to stagger to the wall, where he (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) stood
panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hark!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>cried the Dodger at this moment, <div class="bookquote">`I heard the tinkler.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>Catching up the light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) crept softly upstairs.

<p/>The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in
darkness.  After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered
Fagin mysteriously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`alone?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the
candle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb
show, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had better not be funny just then.  Having performed this
friendly office, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) eyes on the Jew's face, and awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
directions.

<p/>The old man bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
face working with agitation the while, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) dreaded something, and
feared to know the worst.  At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) asked.

<p/>The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to
leave the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; <div class="bookquote">`bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) down. Hush!
Quiet, Charley!  Gently, Tom!  Scarce, scarce!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) recent antagonist, was
softly and immediately obeyed.  There was no sound of their whereabout,
when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hand,
and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a
hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had
concealed the lower portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) face, and disclosed: all haggard,
unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`How are you, Faguey?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. <div class="bookquote">`Pop that
shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it
when I cut; that's the time of day!  You'll be a fine young cracksman
afore the old file now.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) feet upon the hob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`See there, Faguey,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) said, pointing disconsolately to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) top boots;
<div class="bookquote">`not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of
blacking, by Jove!   But don't look at me in that way, man.  All in
good time.  I can't talk about business till I've eat and drank; so
produce the sustainance, and let's have a quiet fill-out for the first
time these three days!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon
the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)
leisure.

<p/>To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the
conversation.  At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently
watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue
to the intelligence he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) brought; but in vain.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) features that they always wore:  and through dirt, and beard, and
whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of
flash Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched
every morsel he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) mouth; pacing up and down the room,
meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement.  It was all of no use.  Toby
continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) could
eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) closed the door, mixed a
glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`First and foremost, Faguey,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Toby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>interposed the Jew, drawing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) chair.

<p/>Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to
declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) feet against the
low mantelpiece, so as to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) boots to about the level of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>)
eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) quietly resumed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`First and foremost, Faguey,'  (<font color='red'><b>the housebreaker</b></font>)</div>said the housebreaker, <div class="bookquote">`how's Bill?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the housebreaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>screamed the Jew, starting from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, you don't mean to say--'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>began Toby, turning pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mean!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. <div class="bookquote">`Where are
they?  Sikes and the boy!  Where are they?  Where have they been?
Where are they hiding?  Why have they not been here?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The crack failed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Toby faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I know it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) pocket and
pointing to it.  <div class="bookquote">`What more?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`They fired and hit the boy.  We cut over the fields at the back, with
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) between us--straight as the crow flies--through hedge and ditch.
They gave chase.  Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon
us.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The boy!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Bill had him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) back, and scudded like the wind.  We stopped to
take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) between us; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) head hung down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was cold. They were
close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows!
We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch.  Alive or
dead, that's all I know about him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVI

<p/>IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY
THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED

<p/>The old man had gained the street corner, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to recover
the effect of Toby Crackit's intelligence.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) had relaxed nothing of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and
disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a
boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) danger:  drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>)
back upon the pavement.  Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the
main streets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) at
length emerged on Snow Hill.  Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) walked even faster than before;
nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) linger until he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) had again turned into a court; when, as if
conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) was now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) proper element, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) usual
shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely.

<p/>Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon
the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley,
leading to Saffron Hill.  In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge
bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns;
for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets.
Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the
windows or flaunting from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are
piled with them. Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its
barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse.
It is a commercial colony of itself:  the emporium of petty larceny:
visited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants,
who traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they
come.  Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant,
display their goods, as sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of
old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and
linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars.

<p/>It was into this place that the Jew turned.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was well known to the
sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out
to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) passed along. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) replied to
their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) reached the further end of the alley; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) stopped, to
address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
person into a child's chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a
pipe at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) warehouse door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!'  (<font color='red'><b>this trader</b></font>)</div>said this
respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew's inquiry after his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>)
health.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, elevating
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyebrows, and crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, I've heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,'  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>replied
the trader; <div class="bookquote">`but it soon cools down again; don't you find it so?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin nodded in the affirmative.  Pointing in the direction of Saffron
Hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`At the Cripples?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>inquired the man.

<p/>The Jew nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Let me see,'  (<font color='red'><b>the merchant</b></font>)</div>pursued the merchant, reflecting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, there's some half-dozen of 'em gone in, that I knows. I don't
think your friend's there.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Sikes is not, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew, with a disappointed
countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`_Non istwentus_, as the lawyers say,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the little man, shaking
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and looking amazingly sly.  <div class="bookquote">`Have you got anything in my line
to-night?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing to-night,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the little man,
calling after him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`Stop!  I don't mind if I have a drop there with
you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>But as the Jew, looking back, waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hand to intimate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very
easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was,
for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively's presence.  By the
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had got upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively,
after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a
shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and
mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pipe with a grave demeanour.

<p/>The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which
the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons:  was the
public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) dog have already figured.
Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight
upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating
himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hand, as if in search of some particular person.

<p/>The room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was
prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded
red, from being visible outside.  The ceiling was blackened, to prevent
its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the
place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely
possible to discern anything more.  By degrees, however, as some of it
cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused
as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye
grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware
of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a
long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of
office in his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a
jingling piano in a remote corner.

<p/>As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over
the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a
song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the
company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the
accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could.  When
this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the
professional gentleman on the chairman's right and left volunteered a
duet, and sang it, with great applause.

<p/>It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from
among the group.  There was the chairman himself, -LRB-the landlord of the
house,-RRB- a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were
proceeding, rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give
himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and
an ear for everything that was said--and sharp ones, too.  Near him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
were the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the
compliments of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a
dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more
boisterous admirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every
vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by
their very repulsiveness.  Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its
stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the
last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you
looked:  others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten
out, and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime;
some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of
life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture.

<p/>Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face
while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without
meeting that of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was in search. Succeeding, at length, in
catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had entered it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>inquired the man, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) out to the landing.  <div class="bookquote">`Won't you join us?  They'll be delighted,
every one of 'em.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head impatiently, and said in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">`Is _he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)_
here?'

 (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And no news of Barney?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>inquired Fagin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`None,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) won't
stir till it's all safe.  Depend on it, they're on the scent down
there; and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) moved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'d blow upon the thing at once.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s
all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>).  I'll
pound it, that Barney's managing properly. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) alone for that.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Will _he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>)_ be here to-night?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis
on the pronoun as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Monks, do you mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired the landlord, hesitating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`Yes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Certain,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fob; <div class="bookquote">`I
expected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here before now.  If you'll wait ten minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) might
be to see the person in question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was nevertheless relieved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
absence.  <div class="bookquote">`Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) I came here to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>); and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) must come to me
to-night.  No, say to-morrow.  As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is not here, to-morrow will be
time enough.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Good!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.  <div class="bookquote">`Nothing more?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a word now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, descending the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I say,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a
hoarse whisper; <div class="bookquote">`what a time this would be for a sell!  I've got Phil
Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!  But it's not Phil Barker's time,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, looking up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Phil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>);
so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry
lives--_while they last_.  Ha! ha! ha!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlord reciprocated the old man's laugh; and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
guests.  The Jew was no sooner alone, than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance resumed its
former expression of anxiety and thought.  After a brief reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes's
residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>muttered the Jew, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) knocked at the door, <div class="bookquote">`if there is any
deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you
are.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) room, the woman said.  Fagin crept softly upstairs, and
entered it without any previous ceremony.  The girl was alone; lying
with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head upon the table, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair straggling over it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been drinking,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>thought the Jew, cooly, <div class="bookquote">`or perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is
only miserable.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man turned to close the door, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made this reflection; the
noise thus occasioned, roused the girl.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crafty face
narrowly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) inquired to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recital of Toby Crackit's story.  When
it was concluded, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sank into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) former attitude, but spoke not a
word.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
feverishly changed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) position, shuffled her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet upon the ground; but
this was all.

<p/>During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to
assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly
returned.  Apparently satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) inspection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) coughed twice
or thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the
girl heeded him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) no more than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had been made of stone.  At length
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) made another attempt; and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hands together, said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
most conciliatory tone,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not
tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), to be
crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And the boy, too,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes to catch a glimpse
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.  <div class="bookquote">`Poor leetle child!  Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The child,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, suddenly looking up, <div class="bookquote">`is better where he (<font color='blue'><b>Nance</b></font>)
is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) lies
dead in the ditch and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) young bones may rot there.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, in amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ay, I do,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>returned the girl, meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) gaze.  <div class="bookquote">`I shall be glad to
have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over.  I
can't bear to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) about me.  The sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) turns me against
myself, and all of you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Pooh!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, scornfully.  <div class="bookquote">`You're drunk.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Am I?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl bitterly.  <div class="bookquote">`It's no fault of yours, if I am not!
You'd never have me anything else, if you had your will, except
now;--the humour doesn't suit you, doesn't it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>rejoined the Jew, furiously.  <div class="bookquote">`It does not.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Change it, then!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>responded the girl, with a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Change it!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
companion's unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, <div class="bookquote">`I
_will_ change it!  Listen to me, you drab.  Listen to me, who with six
words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) bull's throat
between my fingers now.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) comes back, and leaves the boy behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>); if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to
me; murder him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) yourself if you would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) escape Jack Ketch.  And
do it the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too
late!'

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What is all this?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl involuntarily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>pursued Fagin, mad with rage.  <div class="bookquote">`When the boy's worth
hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way
of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could
whistle away the lives of!  And me bound, too, to a born devil that
only wants the will, and has the power to, to--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that
instant checked the torrent of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrath, and changed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole
demeanour.  A moment before, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clenched hands had grasped the air;
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes had dilated; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face grown livid with passion; but now,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the
apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy.  After a
short silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ventured to look round at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared
somewhat reassured, on beholding her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the same listless attitude from
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had first roused her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nancy, dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>croaked the Jew, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) usual voice.  <div class="bookquote">`Did you mind me,
dear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't worry me now, Fagin!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head
languidly.  <div class="bookquote">`If Bill has not done it this time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) will another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) has
done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) can; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) can't he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) won't; so no more about that.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Regarding this boy, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
hands nervously together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The boy must take his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chance with the rest,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>interrupted Nancy,
hastily; <div class="bookquote">`and I say again, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is dead, and out of harm's way,
and out of yours,--that is, if Bill comes to no harm.  And if Toby got
clear off, Bill's pretty sure to be safe; for Bill's worth two of Toby
any time.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And about what I was saying, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>observed the Jew, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
glistening eye steadily upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Your must say it all over again, if it's anything you want me to do,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>rejoined Nancy; <div class="bookquote">`and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow.  You
put me up for a minute; but now I'm stupid again.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of
ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) unguarded hints; but,
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
searching looks, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) original impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being more than a
trifle in liquor, was confirmed.  Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a
failing which was very common among the Jew's female pupils; and in
which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than
checked. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva
which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of
the justice of the Jew's supposition; and when, after indulging in the
temporary display of violence above described, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) subsided, first into
dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the
influence of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) shed tears one minute, and in the next gave
utterance to various exclamations of <div class="bookquote">`Never say die!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and divers
calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a
lady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable
experience of such matters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) time, saw, with great satisfaction,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very far gone indeed.

<p/>Having eased his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
twofold object of imparting to the girl what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had, that night, heard,
and of ascertaining, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own eyes, that Sikes had not returned,
Mr. Fagin again turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) face homeward: leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) young friend
asleep, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head upon the table.

<p/>It was within an hour of midnight.  The weather being dark, and
piercing cold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had no great temptation to loiter.  The sharp wind
that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as
of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all
appearance hastening fast home. It blew from the right quarter for the
Jew, however, and straight before it he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) went: trembling, and shivering,
as every fresh gust drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) rudely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) way.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had reached the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) own street, and was already fumbling
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a
projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road,
glided up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) unperceived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Fagin!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered a voice close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning quickly round, <div class="bookquote">`is that--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>interrupted the stranger.  <div class="bookquote">`I have been lingering here these two
hours.  Where the devil have you been?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`On your business, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
companion, and slackening his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pace as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) spoke.  <div class="bookquote">`On your business all
night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, of course!'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, with a sneer.  <div class="bookquote">`Well; and what's
come of it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing good,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing bad, I hope?'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a
startled look on his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) companion.

<p/>The Jew shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head, and was about to reply, when the stranger,
interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), motioned to the house, before which they had by this
time arrived:  remarking, that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had better say what he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had got to
say, under cover:  for his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) blood was chilled with standing about so
long, and the wind blew through him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).

<p/>Fagin looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could have willingly excused himself from taking
home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered
something about having no fire; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) companion repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) request
in a peremptory manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) unlocked the door, and requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to
close it softly, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) got a light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's as dark as the grave,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, groping forward a few steps.
<div class="bookquote">`Make haste!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Shut the door,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
spoke, it closed with a loud noise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That wasn't my doing,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the other man, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way. <div class="bookquote">`The wind
blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp
with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in
this confounded hole.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs.  After a short absence,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby
Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in
the front one.  Beckoning the man to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) led the way
upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We can say the few words we've got to say in here, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the
Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; <div class="bookquote">`and as there are holes
in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we'll set
the candle on the stairs.  There!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper
flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door.  This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) led
the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a
broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which
stood behind the door.  Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat
himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the
arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face.  It was not quite dark; the
door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble
reflection on the opposite wall.

<p/>They conversed for some time in whispers.  Though nothing of the
conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and
there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be
defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the
latter was in a state of considerable irritation.  They might have been
talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks--by which
name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course
of their colloquy--said, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) voice a little,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I tell you again, it was badly planned.  Why not have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) here
among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him (<font color='blue'><b>pickpocket</b></font>) at
once?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man times</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Only hear him (<font color='blue'><b>pickpocket</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, do you mean to say you couldn't have done it, if you had chosen?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>demanded Monks, sternly.  <div class="bookquote">`Haven't you done it, with other boys, scores
of times?  If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn't
you have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps
for life?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Whose turn would that have served, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew humbly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But not mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, submissively.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) might have become of
use to me.  When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only
reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my
good friend?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What then?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>demanded Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I saw it was not easy to train him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to the business,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew;
<div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was not like other boys in the same circumstances.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Curse him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), no!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man thief</b></font>)</div>muttered the man, <div class="bookquote">`or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been a thief, long
ago.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man thief</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I had no hold upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worse,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man thief</b></font>)</div>pursued the Jew, anxiously
watching the countenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) companion.  <div class="bookquote">`His (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hand was not in.  I
had nothing to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) with; which we always must have in the
beginning, or we labour in vain.  What could I do?  Send him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) out with
the Dodger and Charley?  We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I
trembled for us all.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`_That_ was not my doing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>observed Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>renewed the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`And I don't quarrel with it now;
because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on
the boy to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and so led to the discovery that it was him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) you
were looking for.  Well!  I got him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back for you by means of the girl;
and then _she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ begins to favour him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Throttle the girl!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, we can't afford to do that just now, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew,
smiling; <div class="bookquote">`and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one
of these days, I might be glad to have it done.  I know what these
girls are, Monks, well.  As soon as the boy begins to harden, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll
care no more for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), than for a block of wood.  You want him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made a
thief.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is alive, I can make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) one from this time; and,
if--if--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,--`it's not likely,
mind,--but if the worst comes to the worst, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is dead--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's no fault of mine if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>interposed the other man, with a look
of terror, and clasping the Jew's arm with trembling hands.  <div class="bookquote">`Mind
that.  Fagin!  I had no hand in it.  Anything but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) death, I told you
from the first.  I won't shed blood; it's always found out, and haunts
a man besides.  If they shot him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dead, I was not the cause; do you hear
me?  Fire this infernal den!  What's that?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both
arms, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) sprung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) feet.  <div class="bookquote">`Where?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Yonder! replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall.  <div class="bookquote">`The shadow!
I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the
wainscot like a breath!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew released his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room.
The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been
placed.  It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white
faces.  They listened intently:  a profound silence reigned throughout
the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's your fancy,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll swear I saw it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Monks, trembling.  <div class="bookquote">`It was bending
forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) associate, and,
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could follow, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pleased, ascended the stairs.  They
looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty.  They
descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below.  The
green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug
glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you think now?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, when they had regained the
passage.  <div class="bookquote">`Besides ourselves, there's not a creature in the house
except Toby and the boys; and they're safe enough. See here!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pocket;
and explained, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) first went downstairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had locked them
in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.

<p/>This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His (<font color='blue'><b>Monks</b></font>)
protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they
proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monks</b></font>)
gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Monks</b></font>) excited imagination.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Monks</b></font>) declined any renewal of the
conversation, however, for that night:  suddenly remembering that it
was past one o'clock.  And so the amiable couple parted.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVII

<p/>ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY,
MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY

<p/>As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so
mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) back to the fire, and
the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) coat gathered up under his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) arms, until such time as
it might suit his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) pleasure to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>); and as it would still less
become his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) station, or his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) gallantry to involve in the same neglect a
lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and
affection, and in whose ear he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) had whispered sweet words, which, coming
from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of
whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words--trusting
that he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) knows his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) place, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) entertains a becoming reverence
for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is
delegated--hastens to pay them that respect which their position
demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their
exalted rank, and -LRB-by consequence-RRB- great virtues, imperatively claim at
his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) hands.  Towards this end, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) had purposed to introduce, in
this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and
elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong:  which
could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the
right-minded reader but which he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) is unfortunately compelled, by want of
time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting
opportunity; on the arrival of which, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) will be prepared to show, that
a beadle properly constituted:  that is to say, a parochial beadle,
attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) official
capacity the parochial church:  is, in right and virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) office,
possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and
that to none of those excellences, can mere companies' beadles, or
court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles -LRB-save the last,
and they in a very lowly and inferior degree-RRB-, lay the remotest
sustainable claim.

<p/>Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs,
made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety
the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats
of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times;
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return.
Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney's
approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and
virtuous way of spending the time, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) were further to allay his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney's chest
of drawers.

<p/>Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was
approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded
to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers:
which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture,
carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with
dried lavender: seemed to yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) exceeding satisfaction.  Arriving,
in course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer -LRB-in which was the
key-RRB-, and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken,
gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble
returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) old
attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, <div class="bookquote">`I'll do it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head in a
waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) were remonstrating with
himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) took a view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney,
hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a
chair by the fireside, and covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) eyes with one hand, placed the
other over her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) heart, and gasped for breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Corney,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, <div class="bookquote">`what is
this, ma'am?  Has anything happened, ma'am?  Pray answer me: I'm
on--on--'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron this</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bumble, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) alarm, could not immediately think of the
word <div class="bookquote">`tenterhooks,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">`broken bottles.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, Mr. Bumble!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the lady, <div class="bookquote">`I have been so dreadfully put out!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Put out, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`who has dared to--?  I know!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, <div class="bookquote">`this is them
wicious paupers!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's dreadful to think of!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, shuddering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then _don't_ think of it, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I can't help it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>whimpered the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then take something, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble soothingly.  <div class="bookquote">`A little of
the wine?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not for the world!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Corney.  <div class="bookquote">`I couldn't,--oh!  The top
shelf in the right-hand corner--oh!'   (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>Uttering these words, the good
lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion
from internal spasms.  Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching
a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated,
filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady's lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm better now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half
of it.

<p/>Mr. Bumble raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and,
bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Peppermint,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently
on the beadle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) spoke.  <div class="bookquote">`Try it!  There's a little--a little
something else in it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lips;
took another taste; and put the cup down empty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's very comforting,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Very much so indeed, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle.  As he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) drew a
chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to
distress her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Corney.  <div class="bookquote">`I am a foolish, excitable, weak
creetur.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not weak, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chair a little
closer.  <div class="bookquote">`Are you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`We are all weak creeturs,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general
principle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So we are,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle.

<p/>Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the
expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by
removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney's chair, where it
had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney's apron-string, round which it
gradually became entwined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We are all weak creeturs,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.

<p/>Mrs. Corney sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't sigh, Mrs. Corney,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I can't help it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney.  And she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) sighed again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is a very comfortable room, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble looking
round.  <div class="bookquote">`Another room, and this, ma'am, would be a complete thing.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It would be too much for one,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>murmured the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But not for two, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. <div class="bookquote">`Eh,
Mrs. Corney?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Corney drooped her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) head, when the beadle said this; the beadle
drooped his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>), to get a view of Mrs. Corney's face.  Mrs. Corney, with
great propriety, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) head away, and released her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) hand to get at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr.
Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The board allows you coals, don't they, Mrs. Corney?'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>inquired the
beadle, affectionately pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And candles,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Coals, candles, and house-rent free,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh, Mrs.
Corney, what an Angel you are!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) sank into
Mr. Bumble's arms; and that gentleman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) agitation, imprinted a
passionate kiss upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) chaste nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Such porochial perfection!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. <div class="bookquote">`You
know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) can't live a week, the doctor says,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) is the
master of this establishment; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) death will cause a wacancy; that
wacancy must be filled up.  Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this
opens!  What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Corney sobbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The little word?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty.
<div class="bookquote">`The one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ye--ye--yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>sighed out the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`One more,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>pursued the beadle; <div class="bookquote">`compose your darling feelings for only
one more.  When is it to come off?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak:  and twice failed.  At length
summoning up courage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) arms around Mr. Bumble's neck, and
said, it might be as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) pleased, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">`a
irresistible duck.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract
was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture;
which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of
the lady's spirits.  While it was being disposed of, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) acquainted Mr.
Bumble with the old woman's decease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Very good,'  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>said that gentleman, sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) peppermint; <div class="bookquote">`I'll call at
Sowerberry's as I go home, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) to send to-morrow morning.  Was
it that as frightened you, love?'

 (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It wasn't anything particular, dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady evasively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It must have been something, love,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>urged Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`Won't you tell
your own B.?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the lady; <div class="bookquote">`one of these days.  After we're married,
dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`After we're married!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`It wasn't any impudence
from any of them male paupers as--'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, love!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>interposed the lady, hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If I thought it was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`if I thought as any one
of 'em had dared to lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`They wouldn't have dared to do it, love,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>responded the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`They had better not!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) fist. <div class="bookquote">`Let me see
any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I
can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wouldn't do it a second time!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed
no very high compliment to the lady's charms; but, as Mr. Bumble
accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was much touched
with this proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) devotion, and protested, with great admiration,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was indeed a dove.

<p/>The dove then turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) coat-collar, and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat;
and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) future
partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing,
for a few minutes, in the male paupers' ward, to abuse them a little,
with the view of satisfying himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) could fill the office of
workhouse-master with needful acerbity. Assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) qualifications,
Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) future promotion:  which served to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mind until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) reached
the shop of the undertaker.

<p/>Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and
Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a
greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient
performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was
not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up.  Mr.
Bumble tapped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane on the counter several times; but,
attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the
glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) made
bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) saw what
was going forward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was not a little surprised.

<p/>The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and
butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the
upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an
easy-chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) legs thrown over one of the arms: an open
clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other.
Close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which
Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity.  A more
than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman's nose, and
a kind of fixed wink in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right eye, denoted that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was in a slight
degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) oysters, for which nothing but a strong
appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever,
could have sufficiently accounted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Here's a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte; <div class="bookquote">`try him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>), do;
only this one.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What a delicious thing is a oyster!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>remarked Mr. Claypole, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>)
had swallowed it.  <div class="bookquote">`What a pity it is, a number of 'em should ever make
you feel uncomfortable; isn't it, Charlotte?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's quite a cruelty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>acquiesced Mr. Claypole. <div class="bookquote">`An't yer fond of oysters?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not overmuch,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Charlotte.  <div class="bookquote">`I like to see you eat 'em, Noah
dear, better than eating 'em myself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Lor!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, reflectively; <div class="bookquote">`how queer!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Have another,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.  <div class="bookquote">`Here's one with such a beautiful,
delicate beard!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I can't manage any more,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`I'm very sorry.  Come here,
Charlotte, and I'll kiss yer.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room.  <div class="bookquote">`Say that again, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) apron.  Mr.
Claypole, without making any further change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) position than
suffering his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken
terror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`How dare
you mention such a thing, sir?  And how dare you encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), you
insolent minx?  Kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation.
<div class="bookquote">`Faugh!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I didn't mean to do it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, blubbering.  <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s always
a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, Noah,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>cried Charlotte, reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yer are; yer know yer are!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>retorted Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s always a-doin'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>of
it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and
makes all manner of love!'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Silence!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bumble, sternly.  <div class="bookquote">`Take yourself downstairs,
ma'am.  Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master
comes home, at your peril; and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) does come home, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) that
Mr. Bumble said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was to send a old woman's shell after breakfast
to-morrow morning.  Do you hear sir?  Kissing!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bumble,
holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hands.  <div class="bookquote">`The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in
this porochial district is frightful!  If Parliament don't take their
abominable courses under consideration, this country's ruined, and the
character of the peasantry gone for ever!'   (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>With these words, the
beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker's
premises.

<p/>And now that we have accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) so far on his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) road home, and have
made all necessary preparations for the old woman's funeral, let us set
on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII

<p/>LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) ADVENTURES

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Wolves tear your throats!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>muttered Sikes, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth. <div class="bookquote">`I wish
I was among some of you; you'd howl the hoarser for it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate
ferocity that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) desperate nature was capable of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) rested the body
of the wounded boy across his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) bended knee; and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head, for an
instant, to look back at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pursuers.

<p/>There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud
shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the
neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in
every direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stop, you white-livered hound!'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>cried the robber, shouting after Toby
Crackit, who, making the best use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) long legs, was already ahead.
<div class="bookquote">`Stop!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/>The repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)
was not quite satisfied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) was beyond the range of pistol-shot;
and Sikes was in no mood to be played with.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bear a hand with the boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
confederate.  <div class="bookquote">`Come back!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/>Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for
want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) came slowly
along.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Quicker!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) feet, and
drawing a pistol from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pocket.  <div class="bookquote">`Don't play booty with me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment the noise grew louder.  Sikes, again looking round,
could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing
the gate of the field in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) stood; and that a couple of dogs were
some paces in advance of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's all up, Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>cried Toby; <div class="bookquote">`drop the kid, and show 'em your
heels.'   (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance
of being shot by his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) friend, to the certainty of being taken by his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>)
enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed.  Sikes
clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form
of Oliver, the cape in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been hurriedly muffled; ran along
the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those
behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before
another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pistol
high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ho, ho, there!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a tremulous voice in the rear. <div class="bookquote">`Pincher!
Neptune!  Come here, come here!'

 (<font color='red'><b>masters</b></font>)</div><p/>The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no
particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily
answered to the command.  Three men, who had by this time advanced some
distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my _orders_, is,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the
fattest man of the party, `that we <div class="bookquote">`mediately go home again.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,'  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>said a
shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very
pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I shouldn't wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,'  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>said the third,
who had called the dogs back, <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Giles ought to know.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the shorter man; <div class="bookquote">`and whatever Mr. Giles says, it
isn't our place to contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).  No, no, I know my sitiwation!
Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.'   (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>To tell the truth, the little
man _did_ seem to know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) situation, and to know perfectly well that
it was by no means a desirable one; for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth chattered in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You are afraid, Brittles,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I an't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Brittles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You're a falsehood, Mr. Giles,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Brittles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You're a lie, Brittles,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles.

<p/>Now, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles's taunt; and Mr. Giles's
taunt had arisen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) indignation at having the responsibility of
going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment.
The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll tell you what it is, gentlemen,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`we're all afraid.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Speak for yourself, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the
party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So I do,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man.  <div class="bookquote">`It's natural and proper to be afraid,
under such circumstances.  I am.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So am I,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Brittles; <div class="bookquote">`only there's no call to tell a man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, so
bounceably.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that _he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)_
was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again
with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles -LRB-who had the shortest
wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork-RRB- most handsomely
insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) hastiness of speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But it's wonderful,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had explained, <div class="bookquote">`what a
man will do, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) blood is up.  I should have committed murder--I
know I should--if we'd caught one of them rascals.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as
their blood, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), had all gone down again; some speculation ensued
upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I know what it was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles; <div class="bookquote">`it was the gate.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I shouldn't wonder if it was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Brittles, catching at the
idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You may depend upon it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles, <div class="bookquote">`that that gate stopped the flow
of the excitement.  I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was
climbing over it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the
same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment.  It was quite
obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no
doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because
all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the
instant of its occurance.

<p/>This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the
burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse,
and who had been roused, together with his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) two mongrel curs, to join in
the pursuit.  Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and
steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work:
who, having entered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) service a mere child, was treated as a
promising young boy still, though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was something past thirty.

<p/>Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very
close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round,
whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried
back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its
light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire.  Catching up
the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot;
and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the
light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like
some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was
swiftly borne.

<p/>The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along
the ground like a dense cloud of smoke.  The grass was wet; the
pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of
an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning.  Still,
Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).

<p/>Morning drew on apace.  The air become more sharp and piercing, as its
first dull hue--the death of night, rather than the birth of
day--glimmered faintly in the sky.  The objects which had looked dim
and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually
resolved into their familiar shapes.  The rain came down, thick and
fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes.  But, Oliver felt
it not, as it beat against him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) still lay stretched, helpless
and unconscious, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bed of clay.

<p/>At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and
uttering it, the boy awoke.  His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl,
hung heavy and useless at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) side; the bandage was saturated with
blood.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was so weak, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could scarcely raise himself into a
sitting posture; when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked feebly round for help,
and groaned with pain.  Trembling in every joint, from cold and
exhaustion, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from
head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.

<p/>After a short return of the stupor in which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been so long
plunged, Oliver:  urged by a creeping sickness at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heart, which
seemed to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lay there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) must surely die:  got upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feet, and essayed to walk. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head was dizzy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) staggered to
and fro like a drunken man.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) kept up, nevertheless, and, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head drooping languidly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) breast, went stumbling onward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
knew not whither.

<p/>And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
mind.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who
were angrily disputing--for the very words they said, sounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>)
ears; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) own attention, as it were, by making some
violent effort to save himself from falling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) was
talking to them. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the
previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) felt the robber's
grasp upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) wrist. Suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) started back at the report of
firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights
gleamed before his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand
bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hurriedly away.  Through all these rapid visions, there ran an
undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) incessantly.

<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars
of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) way, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
reached a road.  Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house,
which perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) could reach.  Pitying his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) condition, they might have
compassion on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>); and if they did not, it would be better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) thought,
to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) summoned
up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) strength for one last trial, and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) faltering steps
towards it.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had
seen it before.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) remembered nothing of its details; but the shape
and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).

<p/>That garden wall!  On the grass inside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had fallen on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) knees last
night, and prayed the two men's mercy.  It was the very house they had
attempted to rob.

<p/>Oliver felt such fear come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recognised the place, that,
for the instant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forgot the agony of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) wound, and thought only of
flight.  Flight!  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could scarcely stand:  and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) were in full
possession of all the best powers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) slight and youthful frame,
whither could he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fly?  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pushed against the garden-gate; it was
unlocked, and swung open on its hinges.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) tottered across the lawn;
climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) whole strength
failing him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico.

<p/>It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker,
were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the
night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen.  Not that it was Mr.
Giles's habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants:
towards whom it was rather his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) wont to deport himself with a lofty
affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) superior position in society.  But, death, fires, and burglary,
make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) legs stretched out
before the kitchen fender, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) left arm on the table, while,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of
the robbery, to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) bearers -LRB-but especially the cook and
housemaid, who were of the party-RRB- listened with breathless interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It was about half-past two,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, <div class="bookquote">`or I wouldn't swear that
it mightn't have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and,
turning round in my bed, as it might be so, -LRB-here Mr. Giles turned
round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
to imitate bed-clothes,-RRB- I fancied I heerd a noise.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the
housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker,
who pretended not to hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`--Heerd a noise,'  (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Giles.  <div class="bookquote">`I says, at first, ``This is
illusion''; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the
noise again, distinct.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What sort of a noise?'  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>asked the cook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A kind of a busting noise,'  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles, looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested Brittles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It was, when _you_ heerd it, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Giles; <div class="bookquote">`but, at this
time, it had a busting sound.  I turned down the clothes' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>; continued
Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, <div class="bookquote">`sat up in bed; and listened.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated <div class="bookquote">`Lor!'  (<font color='red'><b>housemaid</b></font>)</div>and drew their
chairs closer together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I heerd it now, quite apparent,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>resumed Mr. Giles. <div class="bookquote">```Somebody,'' I
says, ``is forcing of a door, or window; what's to be done? I'll call up
that poor lad, Brittles, and save him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) from being murdered in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) bed;
or his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) throat,'' I says, ``may be cut from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) right ear to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) left,
without his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) ever knowing it.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) upon the
speaker, and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mouth wide open, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) face
expressive of the most unmitigated horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I tossed off the clothes,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth,
and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, <div class="bookquote">`got softly out of
bed; drew on a pair of--'

 (<font color='red'><b>housemaid</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ladies present, Mr. Giles,'  (<font color='red'><b>housemaid</b></font>)</div>murmured the tinker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`--Of _shoes_, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>housemaid</b></font>)</div>said Giles, turning upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), and laying great
emphasis on the word; <div class="bookquote">`seized the loaded pistol that always goes
upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) room.
``Brittles,'' I says, when I had woke him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), ``don't be frightened!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So you did,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed Brittles, in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">```We're dead men, I think, Brittles,'' I says,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>continued Giles; <div class="bookquote">```but
don't be frightened.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`_Was_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) frightened?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>asked the cook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was as firm--ah! pretty near
as firm as I was.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I should have died at once, I'm sure, if it had been me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div>observed the
housemaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You're a woman,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>retorted Brittles, plucking up a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Brittles is right,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) head, approvingly;
<div class="bookquote">`from a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a
dark lantern that was standing on Brittle's hob, and groped our way
downstairs in the pitch dark,--as it might be so.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Giles had risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) seat, and taken two steps with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) eyes
shut, to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) description with appropriate action, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried
back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) chair.  The cook and housemaid screamed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It was a knock,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. <div class="bookquote">`Open the
door, somebody.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>Nobody moved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in
the morning,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded
him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), and looking very blank himself; <div class="bookquote">`but the door must be opened.  Do
you hear, somebody?'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Giles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being
naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that
the inquiry could not have any application to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>); at all events, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
tendered no reply. Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the
tinker; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had suddenly fallen asleep.  The women were out of the
question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, <div class="bookquote">`I am ready to make one.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So am I,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had fallen
asleep.

<p/>Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat
re-assured by the discovery -LRB-made on throwing open the shutters-RRB- that
it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front.
The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear.  By
the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any
evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by
a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same
ingenious gentleman, the dogs' tails were well pinched, in the hall, to
make them bark savagely.

<p/>These precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the
tinker's arm -LRB-to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) running away, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) pleasantly said-RRB-, and
gave the word of command to open the door.  Brittles obeyed; the group,
peeping timorously over each other's shoulders, beheld no more
formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and
exhausted, who raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their
compassion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the
background.  <div class="bookquote">`What's the matter with the--eh?--Why--Brittles--look
here--don't you know?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver,
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) uttered a loud cry.  Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and
one arm -LRB-fortunately not the broken limb-RRB- lugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) straight into the
hall, and deposited him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) at full length on the floor thereof.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) is!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up
the staircase; <div class="bookquote">`here's one of the thieves, ma'am! Here's a thief, miss!
Wounded, miss!  I shot him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>), miss; and Brittles held the light.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`--In a lantern, miss,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side
of his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) mouth, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) voice might travel the better.

<p/>The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr.
Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in
endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should die before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could be
hanged.  In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard
a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Giles!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered the voice from the stair-head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm here, miss,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles.  <div class="bookquote">`Don't be frightened, miss; I
ain't much injured.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) didn't make a very desperate resistance, miss!
I was soon too many for him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady; <div class="bookquote">`you frighten my aunt as much as the
thieves did.  Is the poor creature much hurt?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Wounded desperate, miss,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Giles, with indescribable
complacency.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was a-going, miss,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>bawled Brittles, in the same
manner as before.  <div class="bookquote">`Wouldn't you like to come and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), miss, in
case he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) should?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush, pray; there's a good man!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the lady.  <div class="bookquote">`Wait quietly
only one instant, while I speak to aunt.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped
away.  She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person
was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles's room; and that
Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to
Chertsey:  from which place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was to despatch, with all speed, a
constable and doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But won't you take one look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), first, miss?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Giles,
with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
had skilfully brought down.  <div class="bookquote">`Not one little peep, miss?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not now, for the world,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady.  <div class="bookquote">`Poor fellow! Oh!
treat him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) kindly, Giles for my sake!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The servant</b></font>)</div><p/>The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned away, with a
glance as proud and admiring as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) own child.  Then,
bending over Oliver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) helped to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) upstairs, with the care and
solicitude of a woman.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIX

<p/>HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH
OLIVER RESORTED

<p/>In a handsome room:  though its furniture had rather the air of
old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance:  there sat two ladies
at a well-spread breakfast-table.  Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous
care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had
taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) station some half-way between the side-board and the
breakfast-table; and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) body drawn up to its full height, his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) left
leg advanced, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) right hand thrust into his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) waist-coat, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
left hung down by his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who
laboured under a very agreeable sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) own merits and importance.

<p/>Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed
oaken chair in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) sat, was not more upright than she (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).  Dressed
with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone
costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which
rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its
effect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) sat, in a stately manner, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) hands folded on the
table before her (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) eyes -LRB-and age had dimmed but little of their
brightness-RRB- were attentively upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) young companion.

<p/>The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood;
at that age, when, if ever angels be for God's good purposes enthroned
in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in
such as hers.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not past seventeen.  Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould;
so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
element, nor its rough creatures her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fit companions.  The very
intelligence that shone in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
noble head, seemed scarcely of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) age, or of the world; and yet the
changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights
that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the
smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside
peace and happiness.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to
raise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes as the elder lady was regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) playfully put
back her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair, which was simply braided on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forehead; and threw into
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless
loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the old
lady, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`An hour and twelve minutes, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles, referring to a
silver watch, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) drew forth by a black ribbon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) is always slow,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>remarked the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Brittles always was a slow boy, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the attendant</b></font>)</div>replied the attendant. And
seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of
thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ever being a
fast one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gets worse instead of better, I think,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the elder lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It is very inexcusable in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stops to play with any other
boys,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady, smiling.

<p/>Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a
respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out
of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door:
and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process,
burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the
breakfast-table together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I never heard of such a thing!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the fat gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`My dear
Mrs. Maylie--bless my soul--in the silence of the night, too--I _never_
heard of such a thing!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands
with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found
themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the fat
gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`Why didn't you send?  Bless me, my man should have come in
a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted;
or anybody, I'm sure, under such circumstances.  Dear, dear!  So
unexpected!  In the silence of the night, too!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having
been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the
established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact
business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two
previous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And you, Miss Rose,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, turning to the young lady, <div class="bookquote">`I--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! very much so, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said Rose, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">`but there is
a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah! to be sure,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`so there is.  That was your
handiwork, Giles, I understand.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights,
blushed very red, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had had that honour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Honour, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`well, I don't know; perhaps it's as
honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at
twelve paces.  Fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fired in the air, and you've fought a
duel, Giles.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust
attempt at diminishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) glory, answered respectfully, that it was
not for the like of him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) to judge about that; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) rather thought it
was no joke to the opposite party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Gad, that's true!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)?  Show me the way.
I'll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie.  That's the little
window that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) got in at, eh?  Well, I couldn't have believed it!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Talking all the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) is
going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a
surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles
round as <div class="bookquote">`the doctor,'  (<font color='red'><b>a surgeon</b></font>)</div>had grown fat, more from good-humour than from
good living:  and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an
old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any
explorer alive.

<p/>The doctor was absent, much longer than either he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) or the ladies had
anticipated.  A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a
bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down
stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that
something important was going on above.  At length he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) returned; and in
reply to an anxious inquiry after his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patient; looked very mysterious,
and closed the door, carefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor,
standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) back to the door, as if to keep it shut.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is not in danger, I hope?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, that would _not_ be an extraordinary thing, under the
circumstances,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`though I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is. Have
you seen the thief?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nor heard anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No.'

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I beg your pardon, ma'am, interposed Mr. Giles; <div class="bookquote">`but I was going to
tell you about him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) when Doctor Losberne came in.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
mind to the avowal, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had only shot a boy.  Such commendations
had been bestowed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) bravery, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could not, for the life of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes;
during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief
reputation for undaunted courage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Rose wished to see the man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`but I wouldn't hear of
it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Humph!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>rejoined the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`There is nothing very alarming in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
appearance.  Have you any objection to see him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) in my presence?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If it be necessary,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the old lady, <div class="bookquote">`certainly not.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then I think it is necessary,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`at all events, I am
quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you
postponed it.  He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow
me--Miss Rose, will you permit me?  Not the slightest fear, I pledge
you my honour!'



 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXX

<p/>RELATES WHAT OLIVER'S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM

<p/>With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised
in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady's arm
through one of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); and offering his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie,
led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, in a whisper, as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) softly turned the handle of
a bedroom-door, <div class="bookquote">`let us hear what you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has not been
shaved very recently, but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) don't look at all ferocious
notwithstanding.  Stop, though!  Let me first see that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is in
visiting order.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepping before them, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) looked into the room.  Motioning them to
advance, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back
the curtains of the bed.  Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged
ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child:  worn with
pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep.  His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wounded arm,
bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) breast; his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head reclined
upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) long hair, as it
streamed over the pillow.

<p/>The honest gentleman held the curtain in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand, and looked on, for a
minute or so, in silence.  Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was watching the patient thus, the
younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the
bedside, gathered Oliver's hair from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face.  As she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stooped over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tears fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forehead.

<p/>The boy stirred, and smiled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sleep, as though these marks of pity
and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had never known.  Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of
water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a
familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes
that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some
brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have
awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What can this mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the elder lady.  <div class="bookquote">`This poor child can
never have been the pupil of robbers!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Vice,'  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, <div class="bookquote">`takes up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) abode in
many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`But at so early an age!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>urged Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`My dear young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
head; <div class="bookquote">`crime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered
alone.  The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`But, can you--oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has
been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said
Rose.

<p/>The surgeon shook his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) head, in a manner which intimated that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) feared
it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the
patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But even if he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) has been wicked,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>pursued Rose, <div class="bookquote">`think how young he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) is;
think that he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) may never have known a mother's love, or the comfort of a
home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven
him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) to herd with men who have forced him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) to guilt.  Aunt, dear aunt,
for mercy's sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick
child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
chances of amendment.  Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never
felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I
might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and
unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) before it is too
late!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`My dear love,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the elder lady, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) folded the weeping girl to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bosom, <div class="bookquote">`do you think I would harm a hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) head?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, no!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, surely,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady; <div class="bookquote">`my days are drawing to their close:
and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to
save him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), sir?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Let me think, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`let me think.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Losberne thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) pockets, and took several turns
up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>)
toes, and frowning frightfully.  After various exclamations of <div class="bookquote">`I've
got it now'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">`no, I haven't,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and as many renewals of the walking
and frowning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles,
and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it.  Giles is a faithful
fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) in a
thousand ways, and reward him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) for being such a good shot besides.  You
don't object to that?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs.
Maylie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There is no other,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`No other, take my word for it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then my aunt invests you with full power,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, smiling through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) tears; <div class="bookquote">`but pray don't be harder upon the poor fellows than is
indispensably necessary.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You seem to think,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>retorted the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`that everybody is disposed
to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for
the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as
vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow
who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that
I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for
doing so, as the present.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>returned Rose,
blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor matter</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, laughing heartily, <div class="bookquote">`that is no very difficult
matter.  But to return to this boy.  The great point of our agreement
is yet to come.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and
although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) musn't be moved or spoken to, on peril of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life, I think we may
converse with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) without danger.  Now I make this stipulation--that I
shall examine him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in your presence, and that, if, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says, we
judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
is a real and thorough bad one -LRB-which is more than possible-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shall
be left to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fate, without any farther interference on my part, at
all events.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor matter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh no, aunt!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>entreated Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh yes, aunt!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`Is is a bargain?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cannot be hardened in vice,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose; <div class="bookquote">`It is impossible.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Very good,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>retorted the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`then so much the more reason for
acceding to my proposition.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down
to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.

<p/>The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial
than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed
on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily.  It was evening, indeed, before
the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was at
length sufficiently restored to be spoken to.  The boy was very ill, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind was so troubled
with anxiety to disclose something, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) deemed it better to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the opportunity, than to insist upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remaining quiet until next
morning: which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should otherwise have done.

<p/>The conference was a long one.  Oliver told them all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) simple
history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength.
It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice
of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities
which hard men had brought upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  Oh! if when we oppress and grind
our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences
of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly
it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their
after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in
imagination, the deep testimony of dead men's voices, which no power
can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and
injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day's
life brings with it!

<p/>Oliver's pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness
and virtue watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) slept.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt calm and happy, and could
have died without a murmur.

<p/>The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to
rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, and condemning them
for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr.
Giles.  And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the
kitchen; so into the kitchen he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) went.

<p/>There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament,
the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker -LRB-who had
received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of
the day, in consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) services-RRB-, and the constable.  The
latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and
large half-boots; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been taking a
proportionate allowance of ale--as indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had.

<p/>The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for
Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) presence of mind, when the doctor
entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) hand, was corroborating
everything, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) superior said it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Sit still!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand.

<p/>`Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles.  <div class="bookquote">`Misses wished some ale to be given
out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir,
and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among 'em here.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen
generally were understood to express the gratification they derived
from Mr. Giles's condescension.  Mr. Giles looked round with a
patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved
properly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) would never desert them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`How is the patient to-night, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>asked Giles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So-so' (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>; returned the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`I am afraid you have got yourself into
a scrape there, Mr. Giles.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope you don't mean to say, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, trembling, <div class="bookquote">`that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)'s going to die.  If I thought it, I should never be happy again.  I
wouldn't cut a boy off:  no, not even Brittles here; not for all the
plate in the county, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That's not the point,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, mysteriously.  <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Giles, are
you a Protestant?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir, I hope so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And what are _you_, boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, turning sharply upon
Brittles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Lord bless me, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Brittles, starting violently; <div class="bookquote">`I'm the
same as Mr. Giles, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then tell me this,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`both of you, both of you! Are
you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is
the boy that was put through the little window last night?  Out with
it!  Come!  We are prepared for you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered
creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger,
that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and
excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor,
shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the
bridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy's
utmost acuteness. <div class="bookquote">`Something may come of this before long.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The constable looked as wise as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could, and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) staff of
office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's a simple question of identity, you will observe,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's what it is, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>replied the constable, coughing with great
violence; for he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) ale in a hurry, and some of it had
gone the wrong way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Here's the house broken into,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor couple</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`and a couple of men
catch one moment's glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke,
and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness.  Here's a boy comes
to that very same house, next morning, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) happens to have
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--by doing which,
they place his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life in great danger--and swear he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is the thief.  Now,
the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not,
in what situation do they place themselves?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor couple</b></font>)</div><p/>The constable nodded profoundly.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, if that wasn't law, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would
be glad to know what was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I ask you again,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thundered the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`are you, on your solemn
oaths, able to identify that boy?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at
Brittles; the constable put his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) hand behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) ear, to catch the
reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the
doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at
the same moment, the sound of wheels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's the runners!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The what?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The Bow Street officers, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Brittles, taking up a candle;
<div class="bookquote">`me and Mr. Giles sent for 'em this morning.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Brittles; <div class="bookquote">`I sent a message up by the coachman, and I
only wonder they weren't here before, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You did, did you?  Then confound your--slow coaches down here; that's
all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, walking away.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXI

<p/>INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Who's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with
the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Open the door,'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>replied a man outside; <div class="bookquote">`it's the officers from Bow
Street, as was sent to to-day.'

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full
width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in,
without saying anything more, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoes on the mat, as coolly
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said
the officer; `he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)'s in the gig, a-minding the prad.  Have you got a
coach <div class="bookquote">`us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?'

 (<font color='red'><b>a coach</b></font>)</div><p/>Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building,
the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
companion to put up the gig:  while Brittles lighted them, in a state
of great admiration.  This done, they returned to the house, and, being
shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed
like what they were.

<p/>The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle
height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close;
half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes.  The other was a
red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured
countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the
stouter man, smoothing down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on
the table.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh!  Good-evening, master.  Can I have a word or two with
you in private, if you please?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div><p/>This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) appearance; that
gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and
shut the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is the lady of the house,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards
Mrs. Maylie.

<p/>Mr. Blathers made a bow.  Being desired to sit down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) hat on
the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same.  The
latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good
society, or quite so much at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ease in it--one of the two--seated
himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and
the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stick into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mouth, with some embarrassment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Blathers. <div class="bookquote">`What
are the circumstances?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at
great length, and with much circumlocution.  Messrs. Blathers and Duff
looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I can't say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>said
Blathers; <div class="bookquote">`but my opinion at once is,--I don't mind committing myself
to that extent,--that this wasn't done by a yokel; eh, Duff?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Certainly not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>replied Duff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I
apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a
countryman?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne, with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's it, master,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Blathers.  <div class="bookquote">`This is all about the robbery,
is it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`All,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking
on?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Blathers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`One of the frightened servants
chose to take it into his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head, that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had something to do with this
attempt to break into the house; but it's nonsense: sheer absurdity.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Wery easy disposed of, if it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>remarked Duff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What he (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) says is quite correct,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed Blathers, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) head in
a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if
they were a pair of castanets.  <div class="bookquote">`Who is the boy? What account does he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
give of himself?  Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) come from? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't drop out of the
clouds, did he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), master?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two
ladies.  <div class="bookquote">`I know his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) whole history: but we can talk about that
presently.  You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves
made their attempt, I suppose?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Blathers.  <div class="bookquote">`We had better inspect the
premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That's the usual
way of doing business.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by
the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short,
went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at
the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in
at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the
shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with;
and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with.  This done, amidst
the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr.
Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of
their share in the previous night's adventures: which they performed
some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one
important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the
last.  This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared
the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for
secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest
point in medicine, would be mere child's play.

<p/>Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy
state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Upon my word,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, making a halt, after a great number of very
rapid turns, <div class="bookquote">`I hardly know what to do.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Surely,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, <div class="bookquote">`the poor child's story, faithfully repeated to
these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I doubt it, my dear young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">`I don't think it would exonerate him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), either with them, or with legal
functionaries of a higher grade.  What is he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), after all, they would
say?  A runaway.  Judged by mere worldly considerations and
probabilities, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) story is a very doubtful one.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You believe it, surely?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>interrupted Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for
doing so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>rejoined the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`but I don't think it is exactly the
tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>demanded Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Because, my pretty cross-examiner,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor: <div class="bookquote">`because,
viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) can
only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.
Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and
will take nothing for granted.  On his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own showing, you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has
been the companion of thieves for some time past; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has been carried
to a police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman's pocket; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman's house, to a place
which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
has not the remotest idea.  He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is brought down to Chertsey, by men who
seem to have taken a violent fancy to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), whether he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will or no; and
is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very
moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing
that would set him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) all to rights, there rushes into the way, a
blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>)! As if on purpose
to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) doing any good for himself! Don't you see all this?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I see it, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, smiling at the doctor's
impetuosity; <div class="bookquote">`but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the
poor child.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`of course not!  Bless the bright eyes of
your sex!  They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side
of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents
itself to them.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pockets, and walked up and down the room with even
greater rapidity than before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The more I think of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`the more I see that it will
occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in
possession of the boy's real story.  I am certain it will not be
believed; and even if they can do nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in the end, still the
dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will
be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan
of rescuing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from misery.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! what is to be done?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried Rose.  <div class="bookquote">`Dear, dear! why did they send
for these people?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Maylie.  <div class="bookquote">`I would not have had them here,
for the world.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`All I know is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne, at last:  sitting down with a kind
of desperate calmness, <div class="bookquote">`that we must try and carry it off with a bold
face.  The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse.  The boy
has strong symptoms of fever upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and is in no condition to be
talked to any more; that's one comfort.  We must make the best of it;
and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours.  Come in!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, master,'  (<font color='red'><b>colleague</b></font>)</div>said Blathers, entering the room followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
colleague, and making the door fast, before he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said any more. <div class="bookquote">`This
warn't a put-up thing.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And what the devil's a put-up thing?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>demanded the doctor, impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Blathers, turning to them,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor's,
<div class="bookquote">`when the servants is in it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nobody suspected them, in this case,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Wery likely not, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Blathers; <div class="bookquote">`but they might have been
in it, for all that.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`More likely on that wery account,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>said Duff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We find it was a town hand,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Blathers, continuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) report;
<div class="bookquote">`for the style of work is first-rate.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Wery pretty indeed it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>remarked Duff, in an undertone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There was two of 'em in it,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Blathers; <div class="bookquote">`and they had a boy
with 'em; that's plain from the size of the window.  That's all to be
said at present.  We'll see this lad that you've got upstairs at once,
if you please.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor face</b></font>)</div>said
the doctor: his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred
to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! to be sure!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Rose, eagerly.  <div class="bookquote">`You shall have it
immediately, if you will.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, thank you, miss!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Blathers, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) coat-sleeve across
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mouth; <div class="bookquote">`it's dry work, this sort of duty.  Anythink that's handy,
miss; don't put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What shall it be?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the doctor, following the young lady to the
sideboard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A little drop of spirits, master, if it's all the same,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied
Blathers.  <div class="bookquote">`It's a cold ride from London, ma'am; and I always find that
spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/>This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who
received it very graciously.  While it was being conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>), the
doctor slipped out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Blathers:  not holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) wine-glass by the stem, but
grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) left hand:
and placing it in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) chest; <div class="bookquote">`I have seen a good many pieces
of business like this, in my time, ladies.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Duff, assisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) colleague's memory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That was something in this way, warn't it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Blathers;
<div class="bookquote">`that was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You always gave that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>)'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>replied Duff.  <div class="bookquote">`It was the Family Pet, I
tell you.  Conkey hadn't any more to do with it than I had.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Get out!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Blathers; <div class="bookquote">`I know better.  Do you mind that
time when Conkey was robbed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) money, though?  What a start that
was!  Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What was that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>inquired Rose:  anxious to encourage any symptoms of
good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down
upon,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Blathers.  <div class="bookquote">`This here Conkey Chickweed--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Conkey means Nosey, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>interposed Duff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course the lady knows that, don't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Blathers.
<div class="bookquote">`Always interrupting, you are, partner!  This here Conkey Chickweed,
miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) had a cellar,
where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and
badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was
conducted in, for I've seen 'em off`en.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) warn't one of the family,
at that time; and one night he (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) was robbed of three hundred and
twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) bedroom
in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) eye,
who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the
robbery, jumped slap out of window:  which was only a story high. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>)
was wery quick about it.  But Conkey was quick, too; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) fired a
blunderbuss arter him (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>), and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a
hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about 'em, found that
Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way
to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost 'em.  However,
he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr.
Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other
bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don't
know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state
of mind about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or
four days, a pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair off in such a desperate manner that many
people was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be going to make away with himself. One day
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview
with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and
orders Jem Spyers in -LRB-Jem was a active officer-RRB-, and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) to go
and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chickweed</b></font>) house.
``I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chickweed</b></font>), Spyers,'' said Chickweed, ``pass my house yesterday morning,''
``Why didn't you up, and collar him (<font color='blue'><b>Chickweed</b></font>)!'' says Spyers.  ``I was so struck all
of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,''
says the poor man; ``but we're sure to have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); for between ten and
eleven o'clock at night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed again.''  Spyers no sooner heard this,
than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put some clean linen and a comb, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
should have to stop a day or two; and away he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes, and sets himself
down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment's notice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed
roars out, ``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is! Stop thief!  Murder!''  Jem Spyers dashes out;
and there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry.  Away
goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars
out, ``Thieves!'' and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time,
like mad.  Spyers loses sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a minute as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turns a corner;
shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; ``Which is the man?''
``D--me!'' says Chickweed, ``I've lost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again!''  It was a remarkable
occurrence, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) warn't to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the
public-house. Next morning, Spyers took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old place, and looked out,
from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eye, till his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own two eyes ached again.  At last, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't help
shutting 'em, to ease 'em a minute; and the very moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hears Chickweed a-roaring out, ``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''  Off he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) starts once more,
with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and after twice
as long a run as the yesterday's one, the man's lost again!  This was
done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that
Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chickweed</b></font>) arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone
mad with grief.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What did Jem Spyers say?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>inquired the doctor; who had returned to the
room shortly after the commencement of the story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Jem Spyers,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>resumed the officer, <div class="bookquote">`for a long time said nothing at
all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
understood his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) business.  But, one morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) walked into the bar, and
taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) snuffbox, says ``Chickweed, I've found out who done this
here robbery.''  ``Have you?'' said Chickweed.  ``Oh, my dear Spyers, only
let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented!  Oh, my dear Spyers,
where is the villain!''  ``Come!'' said Spyers, offering him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) a pinch of
snuff, ``none of that gammon!  You did it yourself.''  So he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) had; and a
good bit of money he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) had made by it, too; and nobody would never have
found it out, if he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) hadn't been so precious anxious to keep up
appearances!'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Blathers, putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) wine-glass, and
clinking the handcuffs together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Very curious, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>observed the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`Now, if you please, you
can walk upstairs.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If _you_ please, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Blathers.  Closely following Mr.
Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver's bedroom; Mr. Giles
preceding the party, with a lighted candle.

<p/>Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
had appeared yet.  Being assisted by the doctor, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) managed to sit up
in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all
understanding what was going forward--in fact, without seeming to
recollect where he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was, or what had been passing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence
notwithstanding, <div class="bookquote">`this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a
spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>ye-call-him's
grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this
morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that
ingenious gentleman with the candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand:  who has placed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.'

<p/>Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was thus
recommended to their notice.  The bewildered butler gazed from them
towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most
ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You don't mean to deny that, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, laying
Oliver gently down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It was all done for the--for the best, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>answered Giles. <div class="bookquote">`I am
sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn't have meddled with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).  I
am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Thought it was what boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>inquired the senior officer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The housebreaker's boy, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Giles.  <div class="bookquote">`They--they certainly
had a boy.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well?  Do you think so now?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired Blathers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Think what, now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Giles, looking vacantly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) questioner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Think it's the same boy, Stupid-head?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined Blathers, impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know; I really don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles, with a rueful
countenance.  <div class="bookquote">`I couldn't swear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you think?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Blathers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know what to think,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>replied poor Giles.  <div class="bookquote">`I don't think it is
the boy; indeed, I'm almost certain that it isn't.  You know it can't
be.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Has this man been a-drinking, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>inquired Blathers, turning to the
doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>said Duff, addressing Mr.
Giles, with supreme contempt.

<p/>Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient's pulse during this short
dialogue; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked,
that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would
perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.

<p/>Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring
apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions
and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on
anything, but the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) own strong mystification; except, indeed,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) declarations that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) shouldn't know the real boy, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were put
before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that instant; that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had only taken Oliver to be he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>),
because Mr. Giles had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes
previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) began to be very much
afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had been a little too hasty.

<p/>Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether
Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow
pistol to that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had fired, it turned out to have no more
destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which
made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had
drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it
make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after
labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a
fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to
the utmost.  Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very
much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took
up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next
morning.

<p/>With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were
in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under
suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff
journeyed accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving
themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been
discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is
only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the
English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King's subjects,
held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence,
that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with
violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the
punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise
as they went.

<p/>In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more
conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the
joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver's appearance if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded
with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the
subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature
consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that
the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the
former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the
great Mr. Conkey Chickweed.

<p/>Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care
of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne.  If fervent
prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in
heaven--and if they be not, what prayers are!--the blessings which the
orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing
peace and happiness.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXII

<p/>OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) KIND FRIENDS

<p/>Oliver's ailings were neither slight nor few.  In addition to the pain
and delay attendant on a broken limb, his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) exposure to the wet and cold
had brought on fever and ague:  which hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) for many weeks,
and reduced him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) sadly. But, at length, he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) began, by slow degrees, to
get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words,
how deeply he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how
ardently he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) hoped that when he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) grew strong and well again, he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) could do
something to show his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) gratitude; only something, which would let them
see the love and duty with which his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) breast was full; something,
however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness
had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had
rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whole
heart and soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Poor fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly
endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pale
lips; <div class="bookquote">`you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will.
We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall
accompany us.  The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and
beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days.  We will employ you
in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The trouble!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh! dear lady, if I could but work for
you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or
watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make
you happy; what would I give to do it!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You shall give nothing at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Miss Maylie, smiling; <div class="bookquote">`for, as I
told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only
take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make
me very happy indeed.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Happy, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver; <div class="bookquote">`how kind of you to say so!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You will make me happier than I can tell you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady.
<div class="bookquote">`To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing
any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an
unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) goodness
and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence,
would delight me, more than you can well imagine.  Do you understand
me?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) inquired, watching Oliver's thoughtful face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh yes, ma'am, yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver eagerly; <div class="bookquote">`but I was thinking that
I am ungrateful now.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`To whom?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>inquired the young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care
of me before,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>rejoined Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`If they knew how happy I am, they
would be pleased, I am sure.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am sure they would,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>rejoined Oliver's benefactress; <div class="bookquote">`and Mr.
Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well
enough to bear the journey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) will carry you to see them.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver benefactress</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>), ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face brightening with pleasure.  <div class="bookquote">`I
don't know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once
again!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the
fatigue of this expedition.  One morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and Mr. Losberne set out,
accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie.  When
they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a
loud exclamation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the matter with the boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor, as usual, all in a
bustle.  <div class="bookquote">`Do you see anything--hear anything--feel anything--eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. <div class="bookquote">`That
house!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes; well, what of it?  Stop coachman.  Pull up here,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the
doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`What of the house, my man; eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The thieves--the house they took me to!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>whispered Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The devil it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`Hallo, there! let me out!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div><p/>But, before the coachman could dismount from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) box, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had tumbled
out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the
deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Halloa?'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said a little ugly hump-backed man:  opening the door so
suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) last kick,
nearly fell forward into the passage. <div class="bookquote">`What's the matter here?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Matter!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the other, collaring him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), without a moment's
reflection.  <div class="bookquote">`A good deal.  Robbery is the matter.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`There'll be Murder the matter, too,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the hump-backed man,
coolly, <div class="bookquote">`if you don't take your hands off.  Do you hear me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I hear you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) captive a hearty shake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Where's--confound the fellow, what's his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) rascally name--Sikes; that's
it.  Where's Sikes, you thief?'

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and
indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor's
grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the
house.  Before he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed
into the parlour, without a word of parley.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige
of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the
cupboards; answered Oliver's description!

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the hump-backed man, who had watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keenly, <div class="bookquote">`what do
you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to
rob me, or to murder me?  Which is it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair,
you ridiculous old vampire?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the irritable doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you want, then?'  (<font color='red'><b>the hunchback</b></font>)</div>demanded the hunchback.  <div class="bookquote">`Will you take
yourself off, before I do you a mischief?  Curse you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`As soon as I think proper,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other
parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to
Oliver's account of it.  <div class="bookquote">`I shall find you out, some day, my friend.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the cripple</b></font>)</div>sneered the ill-favoured cripple.  <div class="bookquote">`If you ever want me,
I'm here.  I haven't lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty
years, to be scared by you.  You shall pay for this; you shall pay for
this.'   (<font color='red'><b>the demon</b></font>)</div>And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and
danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stupid enough, this,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>muttered the doctor to himself; <div class="bookquote">`the boy must
have made a mistake.  Here!  Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself
up again.'   (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>With these words he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flung the hunchback a piece of money,
and returned to the carriage.

<p/>The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations
and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the
driver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant
with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and
vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not forget it for months
afterwards.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until
the driver had resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) seat; and when they were once more on their
way, they could see him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) some distance behind: beating his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) feet upon the
ground, and tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I am an ass!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, after a long silence.  <div class="bookquote">`Did you know
that before, Oliver?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then don't forget it another time.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`An ass,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor again, after a further silence of some
minutes.  <div class="bookquote">`Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows
had been there, what could I have done, single-handed? And if I had had
assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my
own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I
have hushed up this business. That would have served me right, though.
I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on
impulse.  It might have done me good.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon
anything but impulse all through his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) life, and it was no bad compliment
to the nature of the impulses which governed him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), that so far from
being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had the
warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).  If the truth must be
told, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being
disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver's story on
the very first occasion on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had a chance of obtaining any.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver's replies to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still
delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever
been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind to attach full credence to them, from that
time forth.

<p/>As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided,
they were enabled to drive straight thither.  When the coach turned
into it, his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) heart beat so violently, that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) could scarcely draw his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, my boy, which house is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Losberne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That!  That!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window.
<div class="bookquote">`The white house.  Oh! make haste!  Pray make haste! I feel as if I
should die: it makes me tremble so.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Come, come!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the good doctor, patting him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) on the shoulder. <div class="bookquote">`You
will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and
well.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh!  I hope so!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`They were so good to me; so very,
very good to me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The coach</b></font>)</div><p/>The coach rolled on.  It stopped.  No; that was the wrong house; the
next door.  It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up
at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face.

<p/>Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window.
<div class="bookquote">`To Let.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Knock at the next door,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver's arm in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the
adjoining house, do you know?'

 (<font color='red'><b>The servant</b></font>)</div><p/>The servant did not know; but would go and inquire.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) presently
returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) goods, and gone
to the West Indies, six weeks before.  Oliver clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands, and
sank feebly backward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Has his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) housekeeper gone too?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment's
pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir' (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>; replied the servant.  <div class="bookquote">`The old gentleman, the housekeeper,
and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow's, all went together.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then turn towards home again,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne to the driver; <div class="bookquote">`and
don't stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded
London!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The book-stall keeper, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`I know the way there.  See
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), pray, sir!  Do see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the
doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`Quite enough for both of us.  If we go to the book-stall
keeper's, we shall certainly find that he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) is dead, or has set his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) house
on fire, or run away.  No; home again straight!'   (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>And in obedience to
the doctor's impulse, home they went.

<p/>This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in
the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) happiness; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had pleased himself, many times
during his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs.
Bedwin would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>): and what delight it would be to tell them how
many long days and nights he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had passed in reflecting on what they had
done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), and in bewailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) cruel separation from them. The hope
of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
had been forced away, had buoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) up, and sustained him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), under many
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so
far, and carried with them the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was an impostor and a
robber--a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) dying
day--was almost more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) could bear.

<p/>The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) benefactors.  After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather
had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young
leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house
at Chertsey, for some months.

<p/>Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin's cupidity, to the
banker's; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house,
they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took
Oliver with them.

<p/>Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft
tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green
hills and rich woods, of an inland village!  Who can tell how scenes of
peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close
and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded
hearts!  Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives
of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has
indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick
and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even
they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at
last for one short glimpse of Nature's face; and, carried far from the
scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once
into a new state of being.  Crawling forth, from day to day, to some
green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by
the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a
foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they
have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they
watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded
from their dim and feeble sight!  The memories which peaceful country
scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes.
Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the
graves of those we loved:  may purify our thoughts, and bear down
before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers,
in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of
having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time,
which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down
pride and worldliness beneath it.

<p/>It was a lovely spot to which they repaired.  Oliver, whose days had
been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and
brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there.  The rose and
honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks
of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious
odours.  Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall
unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh
turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at
rest.  Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave
in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother lay, would sometimes sit him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) down and sob unseen;
but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes to the deep sky overhead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would cease
to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as lying in the ground, and would weep for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), sadly,
but without pain.

<p/>It was a happy time.  The days were peaceful and serene; the nights
brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched
prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and
happy thoughts.  Every morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went to a white-headed old gentleman,
who lived near the little church: who taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to read better, and to
write:  and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could
never try enough to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would walk with Mrs. Maylie
and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in
some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could
have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would work
hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came
slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) with them:
listening with such pleasure to all they said:  and so happy if they
wanted a flower that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could run to fetch: that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could never be quick enough about it.
When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would
sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low
and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aunt to hear.
There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver
would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a
perfect rapture.

<p/>And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the
other days in that most happy time!  There was the little church, in
the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows:  the
birds singing without:  and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the
low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor
people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that
it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there
together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and
sounded more musical -LRB-to Oliver's ears at least-RRB- than any he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever
heard in church before.  Then, there were the walks as usual, and many
calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver
read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been studying all
the week, and in the performance of which duty he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt more proud and
pleased, than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been the clergyman himself.

<p/>In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o'clock, roaming the
fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild
flowers, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would return laden, home; and which it took
great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the
embellishment of the breakfast-table. There was fresh groundsel, too,
for Miss Maylie's birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the
subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the
cages, in the most approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce
and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of
charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare
cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was
always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which
Oliver -LRB-who had studied this science also, under the same master, who
was a gardener by trade,-RRB- applied himself with hearty good-will, until
Miss Rose made her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) appearance:  when there were a thousand
commendations to be bestowed on all he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) had done.

<p/>So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the
most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled
happiness, and which, in Oliver's were true felicity. With the purest
and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest,
soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of
that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with
the old lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) niece, and that the fervent attachment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>)
young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment
to, himself.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII

<p/>WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN
CHECK

<p/>Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came.  If the village had been
beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its
richness.  The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the
earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and
stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted
open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant
shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine,
which lay stretched beyond.  The earth had donned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mantle of
brightest green; and shed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) richest perfumes abroad.  It was the
prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.

<p/>Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same
cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates.  Oliver had long since
grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) warm feelings of a great many people.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was still the same
gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been when pain and
suffering had wasted his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) strength, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was dependent for every
slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/>One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was
customary with them:  for the day had been unusually warm, and there
was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was
unusually refreshing.  Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had
walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their
ordinary bounds.  Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly
home.  The young lady merely throwing off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) simple bonnet, sat down
to the piano as usual.  After running abstractedly over the keys for a
few minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) played
it, they heard a sound as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were weeping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Rose, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the elder lady.

<p/>Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words
had roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) from some painful thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Rose, my love!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`What is this?  In tears!  My dear child, what distresses you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing, aunt; nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady.  <div class="bookquote">`I don't know what
it is; I can't describe it; but I feel--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not ill, my love?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Maylie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no!  Oh, not ill!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly
chillness were passing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) spoke; <div class="bookquote">`I shall be better
presently.  Close the window, pray!'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver hastened to comply with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) request.  The young lady, making an
effort to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face with
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
was now unable to repress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`My child!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady arms</b></font>)</div>said the elderly lady, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`I never
saw you so before.'

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>rejoined Rose; <div class="bookquote">`but indeed
I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I _am_ ill, aunt.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the
very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had
lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an
anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn
before.  Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush:  and
a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye.  Again this disappeared,
like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was once more deadly
pale.

<p/>Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); but seeing that
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) affected to make light of them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) endeavoured to do the same, and
they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) aunt to
retire for the night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was in better spirits; and appeared even in
better health:  assuring them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) felt certain she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) should rise in
the morning, quite well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, <div class="bookquote">`that nothing is the
matter?  She (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) don't look well to-night, but--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady motioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) not to speak; and sitting herself down in
a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length,
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, in a trembling voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope not, Oliver.  I have been very happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for some years:
too happy, perhaps.  It may be time that I should meet with some
misfortune; but I hope it is not this.'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The heavy blow,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, <div class="bookquote">`of losing the dear girl who has
so long been my comfort and happiness.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh!  God forbid!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Oliver, hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Amen to that, my child!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`Two
hours ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was quite well.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is very ill now,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Maylies; <div class="bookquote">`and will be worse, I am
sure.  My dear, dear Rose!  Oh, what shall I do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own
emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>); and to beg, earnestly, that,
for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be more calm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And consider, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, despite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) efforts to the contrary. <div class="bookquote">`Oh! consider how
young and good she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is, and what pleasure and comfort she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gives to all
about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).  I am sure--certain--quite certain--that, for your sake, who
are so good yourself; and for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own; and for the sake of all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
makes so happy; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will not die.  Heaven will never let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) die so
young.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) hand on Oliver's head. <div class="bookquote">`You think
like a child, poor boy.  But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding.  I
had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned,
for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the
agony of separation from the objects of our love.  I have seen enough,
too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared
to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow;
for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there
is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy.
God's will be done!  I love her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>); and He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knows how well!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>)
checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself
up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) spoke, became composed and firm.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was still more
astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the
care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was every ready and
collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>),
steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under
trying circumstances.  How should he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), when their possessors so seldom
know themselves?

<p/>An anxious night ensued.  When morning came, Mrs. Maylie's predictions
were but too well verified.  Rose was in the first stage of a high and
dangerous fever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Maylie, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) finger on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) lip, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) looked steadily into
his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) face; <div class="bookquote">`this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to
Mr. Losberne.  It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more
than four miles off, by the footpath across the field:  and thence
dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. The
people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to
see it done, I know.'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver could make no reply, but looked his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) anxiety to be gone at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Here is another letter,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; <div class="bookquote">`but
whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I
scarcely know.  I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Is it for Chertsey, too, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver; impatient to execute
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) commission, and holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) trembling hand for the letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the old lady, giving it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mechanically. Oliver
glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire,
at some great lord's house in the country; where, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) could not make out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Shall it go, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I think not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back.  <div class="bookquote">`I will wait until
to-morrow.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) gave Oliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) purse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) started off,
without more delay, at the greatest speed he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could muster.

<p/>Swiftly he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which
sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either
side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers
were busy at their work:  nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stop once, save now and then, for
a few seconds, to recover breath, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) came, in a great heat, and
covered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.

<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) paused, and looked about for the inn.  There were a white bank,
and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was
a large house, with all the wood about it painted green:  before which
was the sign of <div class="bookquote">`The George.'   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To this he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hastened, as soon as it
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eye.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after
hearing what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wanted, referred him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to the ostler; who after hearing
all he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had to say again, referred him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to the landlord; who was a tall
gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots
with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) teeth with a silver toothpick.

<p/>This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out
the bill:  which took a long time making out:  and after it was ready,
and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which
took up ten good minutes more.  Meanwhile Oliver was in such a
desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could
have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to
the next stage.  At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having
been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy
delivery, the man set spurs to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse, and rattling over the uneven
paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along
the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.

<p/>As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and
that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a
somewhat lighter heart.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was turning out of the gateway when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at
that moment coming out of the inn door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the man, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes on Oliver, and suddenly
recoiling.  <div class="bookquote">`What the devil's this?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I beg your pardon, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver; <div class="bookquote">`I was in a great hurry to get
home, and didn't see you were coming.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Death!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) large
dark eyes.  <div class="bookquote">`Who would have thought it! Grind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to ashes! He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d start
up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am sorry,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man's wild
look.  <div class="bookquote">`I hope I have not hurt you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Rot you!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
clenched teeth; <div class="bookquote">`if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might
have been free of you in a night.  Curses on your head, and black death
on your heart, you imp!  What are you doing here?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uttered these words incoherently. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), but fell violently on the ground:  writhing and foaming, in a fit.

<p/>Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman -LRB-for such he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to be-RRB-; and then darted into the house for help.  Having
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) safely carried into the hotel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face homewards,
running as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could, to make up for lost time:  and recalling
with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary
behaviour of the person from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had just parted.

<p/>The circumstance did not dwell in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recollection long, however: for
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind, and
to drive all considerations of self completely from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) memory.

<p/>Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was
delirious.  A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in
constant attendance upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and after first seeing the patient, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) disorder to be one of a
most alarming nature. <div class="bookquote">`In fact,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`it would be little short of
a miracle, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) recovered.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>How often did Oliver start from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bed that night, and stealing out,
with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest
sound from the sick chamber!  How often did a tremble shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) frame,
and cold drops of terror start upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) brow, when a sudden trampling
of feet caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had
even then occurred!  And what had been the fervency of all the prayers
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever muttered, compared with those he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) poured forth, now, in the
agony and passion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) supplication for the life and health of the
gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave's verge!

<p/>Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by
while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance!  Oh!
the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat
violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they
conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to
relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to
alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of
our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what
reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time,
allay them!

<p/>Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke
in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time;
women and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for
hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the
garden, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and
shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay
stretched inside.  Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived.  <div class="bookquote">`It is
hard,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the good doctor, turning away as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) spoke; <div class="bookquote">`so young; so
much beloved; but there is very little hope.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Another morning.  The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked
upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy,
surrounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting
fast.  Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one
of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), in silence.

<p/>There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and
mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the
summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering
overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), that this was not a time for death; that Rose could
surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that
graves were for cold and cheerless winter:  not for sunlight and
fragrance. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) almost thought that shrouds were for the old and
shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in
their ghastly folds.

<p/>A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.
Another!  Again!  It was tolling for the funeral service.  A group of
humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse
was young.  They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother--a
mother once--among the weeping train.  But the sun shone brightly, and
the birds sang on.

<p/>Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had received
from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might never cease showing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) how grateful and attached he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of
thought, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) service; and yet a hundred
little occasions rose up before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might have
been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been.  We need
be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to
some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so
little done--of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might
have been repaired!  There is no remorse so deep as that which is
unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this,
in time.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour.
Oliver's heart sank at sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>); for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) had never left the bedside
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) niece; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) trembled to think what change could have driven
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) away.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) learnt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) had fallen into a deep sleep, from which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell,
and die.

<p/>They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours.  The untasted meal
was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were
elsewhere, they watched the sun as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sank lower and lower, and, at
length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
departure.  Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching
footstep.  They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne
entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What of Rose?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady.  <div class="bookquote">`Tell me at once!  I can bear it;
anything but suspense!  Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You must compose yourself,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`Be calm,
my dear ma'am, pray.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Let me go, in God's name!  My dear child!  She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) is dead! She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) is dying!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor, passionately.  <div class="bookquote">`As He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is good and merciful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>)
will live to bless us all, for years to come.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knees, and tried to fold her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands together; but
the energy which had supported her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) so long, fled up to Heaven with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
first thanksgiving; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sank into the friendly arms which were
extended to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV

<p/>CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN
WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO
OLIVER

<p/>It was almost too much happiness to bear.  Oliver felt stunned and
stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not weep, or speak,
or rest.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had
passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of
tears came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) relief, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) seemed to awaken, all at once, to a
full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost
insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) breast.

<p/>The night was fast closing in, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) returned homeward:  laden with
flowers which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of
the sick chamber.  As he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) walked briskly along the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heard behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace.  Looking
round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as
the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stood leaning
against a gate until it should have passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/>As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap,
whose face seemed familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), although his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) view was so brief that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not identify the person.  In another second or two, the
nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice
bellowed to the driver to stop:  which he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) did, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) could pull
up his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) horses.  Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same
voice called Oliver by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Here!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the voice.  <div class="bookquote">`Oliver, what's the news?  Miss Rose! Master
O-li-ver!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Is is you, Giles?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.

<p/>Giles popped out his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the
other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`In a word!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`Better or worse?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Better--much better!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Thank Heaven!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`You are sure?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Quite, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`The change took place only a few hours
ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door,
leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You are quite certain?  There is no possibility of any mistake on your
part, my boy, is there?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice.
<div class="bookquote">`Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I would not for the world, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`Indeed you may
believe me.  Mr. Losberne's words were, that she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would live to bless us
all for many years to come.  I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) say so.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>The tears stood in Oliver's eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recalled the scene which was the
beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face away,
and remained silent, for some minutes.  Oliver thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
sob, more than once; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feared to interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) by any fresh
remark--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could well guess what his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feelings were--and so stood
apart, feigning to be occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) nosegay.

<p/>All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting
on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and
wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with
white spots.  That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was
abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) regarded the
young gentleman, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) turned round and addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I think you had better go on to my mother's in the chaise, Giles,'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time
before I see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).  You can say I am coming.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles:  giving a final polish to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; <div class="bookquote">`but if you would leave
the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you.  It
wouldn't be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should
never have any more authority with them if they did.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, <div class="bookquote">`you can do as you like. Let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us.
Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering,
or we shall be taken for madmen.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Giles, reminded of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) unbecoming costume, snatched off and
pocketed his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) took out of the chaise.  This done, the postboy drove off;
Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.

<p/>As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much
interest and curiosity at the new comer.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) seemed about
five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
countenance was frank and handsome; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) demeanor easy and
prepossessing.  Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have
had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had not
already spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother.

<p/>Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) son when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) reached
the cottage.  The meeting did not take place without great emotion on
both sides.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mother!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>whispered the young man; <div class="bookquote">`why did you not write before?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I did,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Maylie; <div class="bookquote">`but, on reflection, I determined to keep
back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne's opinion.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`But why,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, <div class="bookquote">`why run the chance of that occurring
which so nearly happened?  If Rose had--I cannot utter that word
now--if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever
have forgiven yourself!  How could I ever have know happiness again!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If that _had_ been the case, Harry,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`I fear your
happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival
here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little
import.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And who can wonder if it be so, mother?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>rejoined the young man; <div class="bookquote">`or
why should I say, _if_?--It is--it is--you know it, mother--you must
know it!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can
offer,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie; <div class="bookquote">`I know that the devotion and affection of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and
lasting.  If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed
behaviour in one she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) loved would break her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) heart, I should not feel my
task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many
struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the
strict line of duty.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`This is unkind, mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry.  <div class="bookquote">`Do you still suppose that I am
a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own
soul?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I think, my dear son,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
shoulder, <div class="bookquote">`that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and
that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more
fleeting.  Above all, I think'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said the lady, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
son's face, <div class="bookquote">`that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a
wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no
fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children also: and, in exact proportion to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) success in the
world, be cast in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth, and made the subject of sneers against
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>):  he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may, no matter how generous and good his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature, one day
repent of the connection he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) formed in early life.  And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may have the
pain of knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does so.'

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be a selfish
brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe,
who acted thus.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You think so now, Harry,'  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And ever will!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.  <div class="bookquote">`The mental agony I have
suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of
a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I
have lightly formed.  On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as
firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman.  I have no thought, no
view, no hope in life, beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and if you oppose me in this great
stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to
the wind.  Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not
disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Harry,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`it is because I think so much of warm and
sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we
have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Let it rest with Rose, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>interposed Harry.  <div class="bookquote">`You will not press
these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle
in my way?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I will not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Maylie; <div class="bookquote">`but I would have you consider--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I _have_ considered!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>was the impatient reply; <div class="bookquote">`Mother, I have
considered, years and years.  I have considered, ever since I have been
capable of serious reflection.  My feelings remain unchanged, as they
ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them
vent, which can be productive of no earthly good?  No!  Before I leave
this place, Rose shall hear me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) shall,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>)
will hear me coldly, mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not coldly,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the old lady; <div class="bookquote">`far from it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`How then?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>urged the young man.  <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has formed no other attachment?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother; <div class="bookquote">`you have, or I mistake, too strong a
hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) affections already.  What I would say,'  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>resumed the old
lady, stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was about to speak, <div class="bookquote">`is this.  Before you
stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried
to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child,
on Rose's history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>)
doubtful birth may have on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) decision:  devoted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) is to us, with
all the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of
self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>)
characteristic.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you mean?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That I leave you to discover,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Maylie.  <div class="bookquote">`I must go back
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>).  God bless you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I shall see you again to-night?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`By and by,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the lady; <div class="bookquote">`when I leave Rose.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) I am here?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Maylie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how
I long to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>).  You will not refuse to do this, mother?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady; <div class="bookquote">`I will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) all.'   (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>And pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son's
hand, affectionately, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hastened from the room.

<p/>Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment
while this hurried conversation was proceeding.  The former now held
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged
between them.  The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious
questions from his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) young friend, a precise account of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patient's
situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as
Oliver's statement had encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to hope; and to the whole of
which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened
with greedy ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>inquired the
doctor, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had concluded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing particular, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said
the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`None at all, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`I am sorry to hear it, because you do that
sort of thing admirably.  Pray, how is Brittles?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The boy is very well, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) usual tone
of patronage; <div class="bookquote">`and sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) respectful duty, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That's well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr.
Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so
hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small
commission in your favour.  Just step into this corner a moment, will
you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder,
and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on
the termination of which, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) made a great many bows, and retired with
steps of unusual stateliness.  The subject matter of this conference
was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily
enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and
having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty,
which was highly effective, that it had pleased his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) mistress, in
consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) gallant behaviour on the occasion of that
attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of
five-and-twenty pounds, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) sole use and benefit.  At this, the two
women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr.
Giles, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) shirt-frill, replied, <div class="bookquote">`No, no' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>; and that if they
observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was at all haughty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) inferiors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) would thank
them to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) so.  And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) made a great many other remarks, no
less illustrative of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) humility, which were received with equal
favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the
purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.

<p/>Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for
the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful
Harry Maylie might have been at first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) was not proof against the
worthy gentleman's good humour, which displayed itself in a great
variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of
small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had
ever heard, and caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to laugh proportionately; to the evident
satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and
made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy.
So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they
could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light
and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and
suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.

<p/>Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) usual
occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had known for many
days.  The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places;
and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more
gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had
seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over
every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic.  The dew
seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle
among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue
and bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our own
thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects.  Men
who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and
gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from
their own jaundiced eyes and hearts.  The real hues are delicate, and
need a clearer vision.

<p/>It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie,
after the very first morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) met Oliver coming laden home, was
seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in
their arrangement, as left his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) young companion far behind.  If Oliver
were behindhand in these respects, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew where the best were to be
found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and
brought home the fairest that blossomed.  The window of the young
lady's chamber was opened now; for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loved to feel the rich summer
air stream in, and revive her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with its freshness; but there always
stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch,
which was made up with great care, every morning.  Oliver could not
help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away,
although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) help
observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) invariably
cast his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head most
expressively, as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) set forth on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) morning's walk.  Pending these
observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.

<p/>Nor did Oliver's time hang heavy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands, although the young lady
had not yet left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now
and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) applied himself,
with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old
gentleman, and laboured so hard that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quick progress surprised even
himself.  It was while he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was engaged in this pursuit, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.

<p/>The little room in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was accustomed to sit, when busy at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house.  It was quite
a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of
jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the
place with their delicious perfume.  It looked into a garden, whence a
wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine
meadow-land and wood.  There was no other dwelling near, in that
direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.

<p/>One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning
to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
books.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had
been uncommonly sultry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had exerted himself a great deal, it is
no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say,
that gradually and by slow degrees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fell asleep.

<p/>There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it
holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things
about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure.  So far as an
overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter
inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called
sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is
going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are
really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate
themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and
imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost
matter of impossibility to separate the two.  Nor is this, the most
striking phenomenon incidental to such a state.  It is an undoubted
fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead,
yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before
us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent
presence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when
we closed our eyes:  and of whose vicinity we have had no waking
consciousness.

<p/>Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own little room; that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) books were lying on the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); that the sweet air was
stirring among the creeping plants outside.  And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was asleep.
Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
thought, with a glow of terror, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was in the Jew's house again.
There sat the hideous old man, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accustomed corner, pointing at
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and whispering to another man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face averted, who sat
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the Jew say; <div class="bookquote">`it is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sure
enough.  Come away.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the other man seemed to answer; <div class="bookquote">`could I mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), think you?
If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exact shape, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to
point him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out.  If you buried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fifty feet deep, and took me across
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn't a mark above it, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay buried there?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver
awoke with the fear, and started up.

<p/>Good Heaven!  what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
heart, and deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) voice, and of power to move!
There--there--at the window--close before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)--so close, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could
have almost touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) started back:  with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes peering
into the room, and meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>):  there stood the Jew!  And beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>),
white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man
who had accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the inn-yard.

<p/>It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes; and they
were gone.  But they had recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) them; and their look
was as firmly impressed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memory, as if it had been deeply
carved in stone, and set before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) birth. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood transfixed
for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called
loudly for help.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXV

<p/>CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER'S ADVENTURE; AND A
CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE

<p/>When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver's cries, hurried to
the spot from which they proceeded, they found him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), pale and agitated,
pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely
able to articulate the words, <div class="bookquote">`The Jew! the Jew!'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry
Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard
Oliver's history from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother, understood it at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What direction did he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) take?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) asked, catching up a heavy stick which
was standing in a corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; <div class="bookquote">`I
missed them in an instant.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then, they are in the ditch!'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry.  <div class="bookquote">`Follow!  And keep as near
me, as you can.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sprang over the hedge, and darted off
with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the
others to keep near him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>Giles followed as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could; and Oliver followed too; and in the
course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and
just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking
himself up with more agility than he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) could have been supposed to
possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting
all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.

<p/>On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader,
striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to
search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time
for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to
communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so
vigorous a pursuit.

<p/>The search was all in vain.  There were not even the traces of recent
footsteps, to be seen.  They stood now, on the summit of a little hill,
commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.
There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain
that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must
have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could
have accomplished in so short a time.  A thick wood skirted the
meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that
covert for the same reason.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It must have been a dream, Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry Maylie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh no, indeed, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, shuddering at the very
recollection of the old wretch's countenance; <div class="bookquote">`I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) too plainly
for that.  I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the wretch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Who was the other?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the
inn,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I
could swear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`They took this way?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>demanded Harry:  <div class="bookquote">`are you sure?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`As I am that the men were at the window,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, pointing
down, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from
the meadow.  <div class="bookquote">`The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew,
running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>The two gentlemen watched Oliver's earnest face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke, and
looking from him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the
accuracy of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said.  Still, in no direction were there any
appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight.  The grass was
long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had
crushed it.  The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but
in no one place could they discern the print of men's shoes, or the
slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the
ground for hours before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is strange!'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Strange?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>echoed the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`Blathers and Duff, themselves, could
make nothing of it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did
not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further
prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance.
Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village,
furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance
and dress of the strangers.  Of these, the Jew was, at all events,
sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been seen
drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any
intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.

<p/>On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but
with no better success.  On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie
repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something
of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless.  After a few
days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when
wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.

<p/>Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) room: was
able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into
the hearts of all.

<p/>But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little
circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more
heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon
some there:  even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to
remark.  Mrs. Maylie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) son were often closeted together for a
long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) face.  After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) departure to
Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that
something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady,
and of somebody else besides.

<p/>At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour,
Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to
speak with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) for a few moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A few--a very few--will suffice, Rose,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said the young man, drawing
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`What I shall have to say, has already
presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are
not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>Rose had been very pale from the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entrance; but that might
have been the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) recent illness.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) merely bowed; and
bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
proceed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I--I--ought to have left here, before,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You should, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose.  <div class="bookquote">`Forgive me for saying so, but I
wish you had.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all
apprehensions,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man; <div class="bookquote">`the fear of losing the one dear
being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed.  You had been dying;
trembling between earth and heaven.  We know that when the young, the
beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits
insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know,
Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade
in blooming.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were
spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bent, and
glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as
though the outpouring of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fresh young heart, claimed kindred
naturally, with the loveliest things in nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A creature,'  (<font color='red'><b>kindred</b></font>)</div>continued the young man, passionately, <div class="bookquote">`a creature as
fair and innocent of guile as one of God's own angels, fluttered
between life and death.  Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was akin, half opened to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) view, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would return to
the sorrow and calamity of this!  Rose, Rose, to know that you were
passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts
upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who
linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that
you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and
the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all
these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved
you--these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine,
by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears,
and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never
know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in
its course.  You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some
drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream
of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a
high and rushing tide.  I have watched you change almost from death, to
life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep
affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has
softened my heart to all mankind.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I did not mean that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, weeping; <div class="bookquote">`I only wish you had left
here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to
pursuits well worthy of you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`There is no pursuit more worthy of me:  more worthy of the highest
nature that exists:  than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`Rose, my own dear Rose!  For
years--for years--I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and
then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to
share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy
moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy's attachment,
and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that
had been sealed between us!  That time has not arrived; but here, with
not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so
long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the
offer.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, mastering the
emotions by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was agitated.  <div class="bookquote">`As you believe that I am not
insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, <div class="bookquote">`that you must endeavour to forget me; not as
your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply;
but, as the object of your love.  Look into the world; think how many
hearts you would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other
passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most
faithful friend you have.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) face with
one hand, gave free vent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) tears.  Harry still retained the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And your reasons, Rose,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, at length, in a low voice; <div class="bookquote">`your
reasons for this decision?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You have a right to know them,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>rejoined Rose.  <div class="bookquote">`You can say nothing
to alter my resolution.  It is a duty that I must perform.  I owe it,
alike to others, and to myself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`To yourself?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, Harry.  I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless,
girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason
to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and
fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects.  I owe it to
you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your
generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty--'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>Harry began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`They do not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, colouring deeply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then you return my love?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry.  <div class="bookquote">`Say but that, dear Rose; say
but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) I loved,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>rejoined Rose, <div class="bookquote">`I could have--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Have received this declaration very differently?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">`Do not
conceal that from me, at least, Rose.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I could,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose.  <div class="bookquote">`Stay!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) added, disengaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">`why
should we prolong this painful interview?  Most painful to me, and yet
productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be
happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which
I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me
with new fortitude and firmness.  Farewell, Harry!  As we have met
to-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which
this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined;
and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can
call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper
you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Another word, Rose,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry.  <div class="bookquote">`Your reason in your own words.
From your own lips, let me hear it!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The prospect before you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>answered Rose, firmly, <div class="bookquote">`is a brilliant one.
All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can
help men in public life, are in store for you. But those connections
are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the
mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) who has so well supplied that mother's place.  In a word,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said the
young lady, turning away, as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) temporary firmness forsook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`there
is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads.  I
will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest
alone on me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`One word more, Rose.  Dearest Rose! one more!'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>cried Harry, throwing
himself before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`If I had been less--less fortunate, the world
would call it--if some obscure and peaceful life had been my
destiny--if I had been poor, sick, helpless--would you have turned from
me then?  Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given
this scruple birth?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do not press me to reply,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>answered Rose.  <div class="bookquote">`The question does not
arise, and never will.  It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>retorted Harry,
<div class="bookquote">`it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the
path before me.  It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the
utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else.
Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name
of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer
me this one question!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then, if your lot had been differently cast,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>rejoined Rose; <div class="bookquote">`if you
had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been
a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement,
and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I
should have been spared this trial.  I have every reason to be happy,
very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded
into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears
with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they
relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said
Rose, extending her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) hand.  <div class="bookquote">`I must leave you now, indeed.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I ask one promise,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry.  <div class="bookquote">`Once, and only once more,--say
within a year, but it may be much sooner,--I may speak to you again on
this subject, for the last time.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not to press me to alter my right determination,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, with a
melancholy smile; <div class="bookquote">`it will be useless.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry; <div class="bookquote">`to hear you repeat it, if you will--finally repeat
it!  I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may
possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not
seek, by word or act, to change it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then let it be so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>rejoined Rose; <div class="bookquote">`it is but one pang the more, and
by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) extended her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) hand again.  But the young man caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) beautiful forehead, hurried from
the room.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI

<p/>IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS
PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST,
AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning;
eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) and Oliver at the
breakfast-table.  <div class="bookquote">`Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two
half-hours together!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You will tell me a different tale one of these days,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry,
colouring without any perceptible reason.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope I may have good cause to do so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Losberne; <div class="bookquote">`though
I confess I don't think I shall.  But yesterday morning you had made up
your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your
mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. Before noon, you announce
that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I
go, on your road to London.  And at night, you urge me, with great
mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of
which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) breakfast when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all
kinds. Too bad, isn't it, Oliver?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and
Mr. Maylie went away, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>rejoined Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's a fine fellow,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`you shall come and see me
when you return.  But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication
from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be
gone?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The great nobs,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>replied Harry, <div class="bookquote">`under which designation, I presume,
you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at
all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it
likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate
attendance among them.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor fellow</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`you are a queer fellow.  But of course they
will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and
these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political
life.  There's something in that.  Good training is always desirable,
whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry Maylie looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) could have followed up this short dialogue
by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a
little; but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) contented himself with saying, <div class="bookquote">`We shall see,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
pursued the subject no farther.  The post-chaise drove up to the door
shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good
doctor bustled out, to see it packed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">`let me speak a word with
you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>);
much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) whole behaviour displayed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You can write well now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope so, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would
write to me--say once a fort-night:  every alternate Monday: to the
General Post Office in London.  Will you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Oliver,
greatly delighted with the commission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I should like to know how--how my mother and Miss Maylie are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said
the young man; <div class="bookquote">`and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks
you take, and what you talk about, and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>)--they, I mean--seem
happy and quite well. You understand me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! quite, sir, quite,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I would rather you did not mention it to them,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Harry, hurrying
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) words; <div class="bookquote">`because it might make my mother anxious to write to me
oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Let it be a secret
between you and me; and mind you tell me everything!  I depend upon
you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) importance,
faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) communications.
Mr. Maylie took leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>), with many assurances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) regard and
protection.

<p/>The doctor was in the chaise; Giles -LRB-who, it had been arranged, should
be left behind-RRB- held the door open in his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) hand; and the women-servants
were in the garden, looking on.  Harry cast one slight glance at the
latticed window, and jumped into the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Drive on!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">`hard, fast, full gallop!  Nothing short of
flying will keep pace with me, to-day.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Halloa!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great
hurry, and shouting to the postillion; <div class="bookquote">`something very short of flying
will keep pace with _me_.  Do you hear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the postillion</b></font>)</div><p/>Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible,
and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound
its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly
disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects,
or the intricacies of the way, permitted.  It was not until even the
dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed.

<p/>And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot
where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away;
for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) from view when
Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seems in high spirits and happy,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) said, at length. <div class="bookquote">`I feared
for a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might be otherwise.  I was mistaken.  I am very, very
glad.'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed
down Rose's face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) sat pensively at the window, still gazing in
the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVII

<p/>IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN
MATRIMONIAL CASES

<p/>Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes moodily fixed on
the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam
proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which
were sent back from its cold and shining surface.  A paper fly-cage
dangled from the ceiling, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) occasionally raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes in
gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy
net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy
shadow overspread his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) countenance.  Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might
be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) own
past life.

<p/>Nor was Mr. Bumble's gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a
pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting
other appearances, and those closely connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) own person,
which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of
his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) affairs.  The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they?  He (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>)
still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) nether
limbs; but they were not _the_ breeches.  The coat was wide-skirted;
and in that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how different!  The mighty
cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one.  Mr. Bumble was no
longer a beadle.

<p/>There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more
substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from
the coats and waistcoats connected with them.  A field-marshal has his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
uniform; a bishop his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) silk apron; a counsellor his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) silk gown; a beadle
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat.  Strip the bishop of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) apron, or the beadle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
hat and lace; what are they?  Men.  Mere men.  Dignity, and even
holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than
some people imagine.

<p/>Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.
Another beadle had come into power.  On him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) the cocked hat, gold-laced
coat, and staff, had all three descended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And to-morrow two months it was done!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh.
<div class="bookquote">`It seems a age.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble might have meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had concentrated a whole existence
of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh--there
was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I sold myself,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection,
<div class="bookquote">`for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small
quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money.  I went
very reasonable.  Cheap, dirt cheap!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Cheap!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble's ear: <div class="bookquote">`you would have been
dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows
that!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) interesting consort,
who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had overheard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Bumble, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Have the goodness to look at me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).  -LRB-If she (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) stands such a eye as that,' said Mr. Bumble to
himself, <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) can stand anything.  It is a eye I never knew to fail
with paupers.  If it fails with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), my power is gone.' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/>Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell
paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or
whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle
glances; are matters of opinion.  The matter of fact, is, that the
matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble's scowl, but, on the
contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh
thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.

<p/>On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first
incredulous, and afterwards amazed.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) then relapsed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) former
state; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) rouse himself until his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) attention was again awakened
by the voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) partner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Mrs. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>rejoined
Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`and although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape,
sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my
prerogative.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`_Your_ prerogative!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I said the word, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`The prerogative of a man
is to command.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And what's the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Corney</b></font>)</div>cried
the relict of Mr. Corney deceased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`To obey, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>thundered Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`Your late unfortunate husband
should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) might have been alive
now.  I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was, poor man!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now
arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or
other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this
allusion to the dead and gone, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) dropped into a chair, and with
a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a
paroxysm of tears.

<p/>But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble's soul;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) heart was waterproof.  Like washable beaver hats that improve with
rain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of
tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) own power, pleased and exalted him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) good lady with
looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should cry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hardest:  the exercise being looked upon, by the
faculty, as strongly conducive to health.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and
softens down the temper,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`So cry away.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat
from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man
might, who felt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had asserted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) superiority in a becoming manner,
thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with
much ease and waggishness depicted in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole appearance.

<p/>Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less
troublesome than a manual assault; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) was quite prepared to make
trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in
discovering.

<p/>The first proof he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow
sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat to the
opposite end of the room.  This preliminary proceeding laying bare his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
head, the expert lady, clasping him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) tightly round the throat with one
hand, inflicted a shower of blows -LRB-dealt with singular vigour and
dexterity-RRB- upon it with the other.  This done, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) created a little
variety by scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) face, and tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hair; and, having, by
this time, inflicted as much punishment as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deemed necessary for the
offence, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) over a chair, which was luckily well situated
for the purpose:  and defied him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) to talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) prerogative again,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) dared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Get up!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command.  <div class="bookquote">`And take yourself
away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance:  wondering much what
something desperate might be.  Picking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) looked towards
the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Are you going?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Certainly, my dear, certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker
motion towards the door.  <div class="bookquote">`I didn't intend to--I'm going, my dear!  You
are so very violent, that really I--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the
carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle.  Mr. Bumble
immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) unfinished sentence:  leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full
possession of the field.

<p/>Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had a
decided propensity for bullying:  derived no inconsiderable pleasure
from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was -LRB-it is
needless to say-RRB- a coward.  This is by no means a disparagement to his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)
character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect
and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities.  The remark is
made, indeed, rather in his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) favour than otherwise, and with a view of
impressing the reader with a just sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) qualifications for
office.

<p/>But, the measure of his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) degradation was not yet full.  After making a
tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws
really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their
wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be
visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious
individuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some
of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish
linen:  when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hem!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) native dignity. <div class="bookquote">`These
women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. Hallo! hallo
there!  What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very
fierce and angry manner:  which was at once exchanged for a most
humiliated and cowering air, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes unexpectedly rested on the
form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lady wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`My dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`I didn't know you were here.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Didn't know I was here!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`What do _you_ do
here?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work
properly, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble:  glancing distractedly at a
couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of
admiration at the workhouse-master's humility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`_You_ thought they were talking too much?'  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`What
business is it of yours?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, my dear--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>urged Mr. Bumble submissively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What business is it of yours?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's very true, you're matron here, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>submitted Mr. Bumble;
<div class="bookquote">`but I thought you mightn't be in the way just then.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lady.  <div class="bookquote">`We don't want
any of your interference.  You're a great deal too fond of poking your
nose into things that don't concern you, making everybody in the house
laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a
fool every hour in the day.  Be off; come!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two
old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated
for an instant.  Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught
up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) towards the door, ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) portly
person.

<p/>What could Mr. Bumble do?  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) looked dejectedly round, and slunk away;
and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a
shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight.  It wanted but this.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was
degraded in their eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had lost caste and station before the very
paupers; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to
the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`All in two months!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.
<div class="bookquote">`Two months!  No more than two months ago, I was not only my own
master, but everybody else's, so far as the porochial workhouse was
concerned, and now!--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>It was too much.  Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the
gate for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had reached the portal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) reverie-RRB-; and
walked, distractedly, into the street.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated
the first passion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) thirsty.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) passed a great many public-houses; but, at length
paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) gathered from a
hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary
customer.  It began to rain, heavily, at the moment.  This determined
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).  Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had looked from the
street.

<p/>The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large
cloak.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain
haggardness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look, as well as by the dusty soils on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dress, to
have travelled some distance.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyed Bumble askance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered,
but scarcely deigned to nod his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head in acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
salutation.

<p/>Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the
stranger had been more familiar:  so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) gin-and-water in
silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.

<p/>It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall
into company under such circumstances:  that Mr. Bumble felt, every now
and then, a powerful inducement, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) could not resist, to steal a
look at the stranger:  and that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment
stealing a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).  Mr. Bumble's awkwardness was enhanced by the
very remarkable expression of the stranger's eye, which was keen and
bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike
anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.

<p/>When they had encountered each other's glance several times in this
way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Were you looking for me,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`when you peered in at the window?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not that I am aware of, unless you're Mr.--'   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Here Mr. Bumble stopped
short; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was curious to know the stranger's name, and thought in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) impatience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) might supply the blank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I see you were not,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm
playing about his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mouth; <div class="bookquote">`or you have known my name.  You don't know
it.  I would recommend you not to ask for it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger expression</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I meant no harm, young man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And have done none,'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger.

<p/>Another silence succeeded this short dialogue:  which was again broken
by the stranger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I have seen you before, I think?'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`You were differently
dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should
know you again.  You were beadle here, once; were you not?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; <div class="bookquote">`porochial beadle.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Just so,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined the other, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head.  <div class="bookquote">`It was in that
character I saw you.  What are you now?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Master of the workhouse,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and
impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might
otherwise assume.  <div class="bookquote">`Master of the workhouse, young man!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I
doubt not?'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble's
eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) raised them in astonishment at the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't scruple to answer freely, man.  I know you pretty well, you see.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I suppose, a married man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident
perplexity, <div class="bookquote">`is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) can,
than a single one.  Porochial officers are not so well paid that they
can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a
civil and proper manner.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>The stranger smiled, and nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head again: as much to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had
not mistaken his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) man; then rang the bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Fill this glass again,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said, handing Mr. Bumble's empty tumbler to
the landlord.  <div class="bookquote">`Let it be strong and hot.  You like it so, I suppose?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not too strong,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You understand what that means, landlord!'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, drily.

<p/>The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a
steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr.
Bumble's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now listen to me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, after closing the door and
window.  <div class="bookquote">`I came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by
one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) friends
sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you
were uppermost in my mind.  I want some information from you.  I don't
ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is.  Put up that, to begin
with.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money
should be heard without.  When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the
coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much
satisfaction, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) went on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Carry your memory back--let me see--twelve years, last winter.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's a long time,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`Very good.  I've done it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The scene, the workhouse.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Good!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And the time, night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable
drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to
themselves--gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and
hid their shame, rot 'em in the grave!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The lying-in room, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, not quite following
the stranger's excited description.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger.  <div class="bookquote">`A boy was born there.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A many boys,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head, despondingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A murrain on the young devils!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried the stranger; `I speak of one; a
meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a
coffin-maker--I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coffin, and screwed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) body in
it--and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, you mean Oliver!  Young Twist!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>),
of course.  There wasn't a obstinater young rascal--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's not of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) I want to hear; I've heard enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the
stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject
of poor Oliver's vices.  <div class="bookquote">`It's of a woman; the hag that nursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
mother.  Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered
facetious.  <div class="bookquote">`It would be hard to tell.  There's no midwifery there,
whichever place she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s gone to; so I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s out of employment,
anyway.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>demanded the stranger, sternly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died last winter,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble.

<p/>The man looked fixedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had given this information, and
although he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) did not withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes for some time afterwards, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) seemed lost in
thought.  For some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) appeared doubtful whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) ought to be
relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) breathed
more freely; and withdrawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes, observed that it was no great
matter. With that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) rose, as if to depart.

<p/>But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) at once saw that an
opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in
the possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) better half.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) well remembered the night of old
Sally's death, which the occurrences of that day had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) good
reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had proposed to Mrs.
Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) the disclosure
of which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been the solitary witness, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had heard enough to know
that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman's
attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist.
Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) informed the stranger,
with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old
harridan shortly before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) had reason
to believe, throw some light on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`How can I find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, thrown off his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) guard; and
plainly showing that all his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) fears -LRB-whatever they were-RRB- were aroused
afresh by the intelligence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Only through me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`When?'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>cried the stranger, hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`To-morrow,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`At nine in the evening,'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, producing a scrap of
paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side,
in characters that betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) agitation; <div class="bookquote">`at nine in the evening,
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to me there.  I needn't tell you to be secret.  It's your
interest.'

 (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for
the liquor that had been drunk.  Shortly remarking that their roads
were different, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic
repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night.

<p/>On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it
contained no name.  The stranger had not gone far, so he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) made after him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
to ask it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you want?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble
touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) on the arm.  <div class="bookquote">`Following me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Only to ask a question,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, pointing to the scrap of
paper.  <div class="bookquote">`What name am I to ask for?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Monks!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>rejoined the man; and strode hastily, away.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII

<p/>CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND
MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW

<p/>It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening.  The clouds, which had
been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of
vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a
violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the
main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered
little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half,
or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon
the river.

<p/>They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might,
perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the
rain, and sheltering them from observation.  The husband carried a
lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few
paces in front, as though--the way being dirty--to give his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife the
benefit of treading in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heavy footprints.  They went on, in profound
silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) pace, and turned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head as if to make sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) helpmate was following; then,
discovering that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) heels, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mended his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) rate of
walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards
their place of destination.

<p/>This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long
been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under
various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on
plunder and crime.  It was a collection of mere hovels:  some, hastily
built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled
together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for
the most part, within a few feet of the river's bank.  A few leaky
boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which
skirted it:  and here and there an oar or coil of rope:  appeared, at
first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages
pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and
useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a
passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were
disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with
any view to their being actually employed.

<p/>In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its
upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a
manufactory of some kind.  It had, in its day, probably furnished
employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements.  But it had
long since gone to ruin.  The rat, the worm, and the action of the
damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a
considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the
water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream,
seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion,
and involving itself in the same fate.

<p/>It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as
the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain
commenced pouring violently down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The place should be somewhere here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Bumble, consulting a scrap
of paper he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Halloa there!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a voice from above.

<p/>Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head and descried a man
looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stand still, a minute,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the voice; <div class="bookquote">`I'll be with you directly.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is that the man?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Bumble's good lady.

<p/>Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then, mind what I told you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron: <div class="bookquote">`and be careful to say
as little as you can, or you'll betray us at once.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was
apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of
proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was
prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near
which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come in!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cried impatiently, stamping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) foot upon the ground.
<div class="bookquote">`Don't keep me here!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any
other invitation.  Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind,
followed:  obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that
remarkable dignity which was usually his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chief characteristic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said
Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had bolted the
door behind them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We--we were only cooling ourselves,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>stammered Bumble, looking
apprehensively about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Cooling yourselves!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>retorted Monks.  <div class="bookquote">`Not all the rain that ever
fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell's fire out, as a man
can carry about with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  You won't cool yourself so easily; don't
think it!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and
bent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gaze upon her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>), till even she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>), who was not easily cowed, was
fain to withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) eyes, and turn them towards the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is the woman, is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>demanded Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hem!  That is the woman,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wife's
caution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron,
interposing, and returning, as she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) spoke, the searching look of Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I know they will always keep _one_ till it's found out,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And what may that be?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>asked the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The loss of their own good name,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Monks.  <div class="bookquote">`So, by the same
rule, if a woman's a party to a secret that might hang or transport
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), I'm not afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) telling it to anybody; not I!  Do you
understand, mistress?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course you don't!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks.  <div class="bookquote">`How should you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div><p/>Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) two
companions, and again beckoning them to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), the man hastened
across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the
roof.  He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder,
leading to another floor of warehouses above:  when a bright flash of
lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed,
which shook the crazy building to its centre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hear it!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) cried, shrinking back.  <div class="bookquote">`Hear it!  Rolling and crashing
on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were
hiding from it.  I hate the sound!'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hands
suddenly from his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr.
Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`These fits come over me, now and then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, observing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
alarm; <div class="bookquote">`and thunder sometimes brings them on. Don't mind me now; it's
all over for this once.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the
window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which
hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy
beams in the ceiling:  and which cast a dim light upon an old table and
three chairs that were placed beneath it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, <div class="bookquote">`the
sooner we come to our business, the better for all.  The woman know
what it is, does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>The question was addressed to Bumble; but his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wife anticipated the
reply, by intimating that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was perfectly acquainted with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) died;
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) told you something--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`About the mother of the boy you named,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied the matron
interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`Yes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The first question is, of what nature was her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) communication?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said
Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's the second,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>observed the woman with much deliberation. <div class="bookquote">`The
first is, what may the communication be worth?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Bumble: who did
not want for spirit, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Humph!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry;
<div class="bookquote">`there may be money's worth to get, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps there may,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the composed reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Something that was taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks.  <div class="bookquote">`Something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
wore.  Something that--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You had better bid,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mrs. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`I have heard enough,
already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) better half into any
greater share of the secret than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had originally possessed, listened
to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes:  which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
directed towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised
astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded,
what sum was required for the disclosure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's it worth to you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>asked the woman, as collectedly as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Monks. <div class="bookquote">`Speak
out, and let me know which.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty
pounds in gold,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman; <div class="bookquote">`and I'll tell you all I know.  Not
before.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Five-and-twenty pounds!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Monks, drawing back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I spoke as plainly as I could,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`It's not a
large sum, either.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it's
told!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>cried Monks impatiently; <div class="bookquote">`and which has been lying dead for
twelve years past or more!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value
in course of time,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>answered the matron, still preserving the resolute
indifference she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) had assumed.  <div class="bookquote">`As to lying dead, there are those who
will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for
anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What if I pay it for nothing?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks, hesitating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You can easily take it away again,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied the matron. <div class="bookquote">`I am but a
woman; alone here; and unprotected.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>submitted Mr. Bumble,
in a voice tremulous with fear: <div class="bookquote">`_I_ am here, my dear. And besides,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) teeth chattering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Monks is too
much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons.  Mr.
Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a
little run to seed, as I may say; bu he (<font color='blue'><b>Monks</b></font>) has heerd:  I say I have no
doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear:  that I am a very determined
officer, with very uncommon strength, if I'm once roused.  I only want
a little rousing; that's all.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Bumble spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) made a melancholy feint of grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lantern
with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed
expression of every feature, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) _did_ want a little rousing, and
not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless,
indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for
the purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You are a fool,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; <div class="bookquote">`and had better hold your
tongue.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had better have cut it out, before he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) came, if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) can't speak in a
lower tone,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, grimly.  <div class="bookquote">`So!  He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s your husband, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) my husband!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>tittered the matron, parrying the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I thought as much, when you came in,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>rejoined Monks, marking the
angry glance which the lady darted at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spouse as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke.  <div class="bookquote">`So
much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people,
when I find that there's only one will between them.  I'm in earnest.
See here!'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told
out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the
woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder,
which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let's
hear your story.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break
almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) face from
the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say.  The
faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small
table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to
render her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whisper audible.  The sickly rays of the suspended lantern
falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of
their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness,
looked ghastly in the extreme.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>the matron began,
<div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) and I were alone.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Was there no one by?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; <div class="bookquote">`No
sick wretch or idiot in some other bed?  No one who could hear, and
might, by possibility, understand?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a soul,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the woman; <div class="bookquote">`we were alone.  _I_ stood alone
beside the body when death came over it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Good,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attentively.  <div class="bookquote">`Go on.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke of a young creature,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>resumed the matron, <div class="bookquote">`who had brought a
child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room,
but in the same bed, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) then lay dying.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ay?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) shoulder,
<div class="bookquote">`Blood!  How things come about!'

 (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The child was the one you named to him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) last night,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron,
nodding carelessly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) husband; <div class="bookquote">`the mother this nurse had
robbed.'

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`In life?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`In death,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the woman, with something like a shudder. <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the
dead mother had prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last breath, to keep for the
infant's sake.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sold it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; <div class="bookquote">`did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sell it?
Where?  When?  To whom?  How long before?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`As she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told me, with great difficulty, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had done this,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said
the matron, <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) fell back and died.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Without saying more?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very
suppression, seemed only the more furious.  <div class="bookquote">`It's a lie! I'll not be
played with.  She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) said more.  I'll tear the life out of you both, but
I'll know what it was.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) didn't utter another word,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, to all appearance
unmoved -LRB-as Mr. Bumble was very far from being-RRB- by the strange man's
violence; <div class="bookquote">`but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which
was partly closed; and when I saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dead, and so removed the
hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Which contained--'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>interposed Monks, stretching forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the woman; <div class="bookquote">`it was a pawnbroker's duplicate.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`For what?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>demanded Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`In good time I'll tell you.'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman.  <div class="bookquote">`I judge that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better
account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together
money to pay the pawnbroker's interest year by year, and prevent its
running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be
redeemed.  Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died with
the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.  The time was
out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and
so redeemed the pledge.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Where is it now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`_There_,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied the woman.  And, as if glad to be relieved of it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough
for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling
hands.  It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of
hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It has the word ``Agnes'' engraved on the inside,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date;
which is within a year before the child was born.  I found out that.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And this is all?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the
contents of the little packet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`All,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the woman.

<p/>Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) were glad to find that the
story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty
pounds back again; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) took courage to wipe the perspiration
which had been trickling over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) nose, unchecked, during the whole of
the previous dialogue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; <div class="bookquote">`and I want to know
nothing; for it's safer not.  But I may ask you two questions, may I?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You may ask,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, with some show of surprise; <div class="bookquote">`but whether I
answer or not is another question.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`--Which makes three,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of
facetiousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is that what you expected to get from me?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>demanded the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Monks.  <div class="bookquote">`The other question?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you propose to do with it?  Can it be used against me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Never,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks either</b></font>)</div>rejoined Monks; <div class="bookquote">`nor against me either.  See here!  But don't
move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks either</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an
iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened
close at Mr. Bumble's feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several
paces backward, with great precipitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Look down,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. <div class="bookquote">`Don't
fear me.  I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were
seated over it, if that had been my game.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble
himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid
water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all
other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against
the green and slimy piles.  There had once been a water-mill beneath;
the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments
of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new
impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted
to stem its headlong course.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If you flung a man's body down there, where would it be to-morrow
morning?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied
Bumble, recoiling at the thought.

<p/>Monks drew the little packet from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hurriedly
thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of
some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream.
It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely
audible splash; and was gone.

<p/>The three looking into each other's faces, seemed to breathe more
freely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back
into its former position.  <div class="bookquote">`If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books
say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash
among it.  We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant
party.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`By all means,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You'll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, with a
threatening look.  <div class="bookquote">`I am not afraid of your wife.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You may depend upon me, young man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Bumble, bowing
himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. <div class="bookquote">`On
everybody's account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>remarked Monks. <div class="bookquote">`Light your
lantern!  And get away from here as fast as you can.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr.
Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would
infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now
carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse,
descended in silence, followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wife.  Monks brought up the rear,
after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other
sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the
rushing of the water.

<p/>They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks
started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lantern a foot
above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a
marvellously light step for a gentleman of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) figure:  looking
nervously about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for hidden trap-doors.  The gate at which they had
entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a
nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into
the wet and darkness outside.

<p/>They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an
invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been
hidden somewhere below. Bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) go first, and bear the light, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
returned to the chamber he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had just quitted.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX

<p/>INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY
ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS
TOGETHER

<p/>On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned
in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as
therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily
growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.

<p/>The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of
those he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it
was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great
distance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) former lodgings.  It was not, in appearance, so
desirable a habitation as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) old quarters:  being a mean and
badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one
small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty
lane.  Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman's
having gone down in the world of late:  for a great scarcity of
furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the
disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen,
bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated
condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these
symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.

<p/>The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) white great-coat,
by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree
improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled
nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week's growth.  The dog sat at
the bedside:  now eyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) master with a wistful look, and now
pricking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the
street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) attention.
Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which
formed a portion of the robber's ordinary dress, was a female:  so pale
and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been
considerable difficulty in recognising her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) as the same Nancy who has
already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) replied to
Mr. Sikes's question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not long gone seven,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`How do you feel to-night, Bill?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`As weak as water,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes
and limbs.  <div class="bookquote">`Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering
bed anyhow.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes's temper; for, as the girl raised
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) up and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to a chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) muttered various curses on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
awkwardness, and struck her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Whining are you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Come!  Don't stand snivelling there.
If you can't do anything better than that, cut off altogether.  D'ye
hear me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I hear you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face aside, and forcing a
laugh.  <div class="bookquote">`What fancy have you got in your head now?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! you've thought better of it, have you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes, marking the
tear which trembled in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eye.  <div class="bookquote">`All the better for you, you have.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, you don't mean to say, you'd be hard upon me to-night, Bill,'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Why not?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Such a number of nights,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl number</b></font>)</div>said the girl, with a touch of woman's
tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even
to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice: <div class="bookquote">`such a number of nights as I've been patient with you,
nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the
first that I've seen you like yourself; you wouldn't have served me as
you did just now, if you'd thought of that, would you?  Come, come; say
you wouldn't.'

 (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`I wouldn't.  Why, damme, now, the
girls's whining again!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. <div class="bookquote">`Don't
you seem to mind me.  It'll soon be over.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What'll be over?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. <div class="bookquote">`What foolery
are you up to, now, again?  Get up and bustle about, and don't come
over me with your woman's nonsense.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was
delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really
weak and exhausted, dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head over the back of the chair, and
fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths
with which, on similar occasions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was accustomed to garnish his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
threats.  Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon
emergency; for Miss Nancy's hysterics were usually of that violent kind
which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance;
Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment
wholly ineffectual, called for assistance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the matter here, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, looking in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Lend a hand to the girl, can't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes impatiently. <div class="bookquote">`Don't
stand chattering and grinning at me!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl's
assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins -LRB-otherwise the Artful Dodger-RRB-, who
had followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on
the floor a bundle with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) was laden; and snatching a bottle from
the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) heels, uncorked
it in a twinkling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) teeth, and poured a portion of its contents
down the patient's throat:  previously taking a taste, himself, to
prevent mistakes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawkins/Mr. John Dawkins/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Dawkins; <div class="bookquote">`and you slap her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the
petticuts.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawkins/Mr. John Dawkins/John</b></font>)</div><p/>These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially
that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry:  were not
long in producing the desired effect.  The girl gradually recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face upon
the pillow:  leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some
astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) asked Fagin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and
I've brought something good with me, that you'll be glad to see.
Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that
we spent all our money on, this morning.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>In compliance with Mr. Fagin's request, the Artful untied this bundle,
which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed
the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed
them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and
excellence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing
to view a huge pasty; <div class="bookquote">`sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender
limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there's no
occasion to pick 'em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so
precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it'll go nigh to
blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that
the niggers didn't work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a
pitch of goodness,--oh no!  Two half-quartern brans; pound of best
fresh; piece of double Glo`ster; and, to wind up all, some of the
richest sort you ever lushed!'

 (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while
Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw
spirits from the bottle he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) carried:  which the invalid tossed down his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>)
throat without a moment's hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hands with great satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">`You'll
do, Bill; you'll do now.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`I might have been done for, twenty times
over, afore you'd have done anything to help me.  What do you mean by
leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted
wagabond?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Only hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), boys!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">`And us
come to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) all these beau-ti-ful things.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The things is well enough in their way,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Sikes:  a little
soothed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) glanced over the table; `but what have you got to say for
yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health,
blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this
mortal time, than if I was that <div class="bookquote">`ere dog.--Drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) down, Charley!'

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I never see such a jolly dog as that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>cried Master Bates, doing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
was desired.  <div class="bookquote">`Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)'d make his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) fortun'  (<font color='red'><b>dog</b></font>)</div>on the stage that dog would, and rewive the
drayma besides.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hold your din,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still
growling angrily.  <div class="bookquote">`What have you got to say for yourself, you withered
old fence, eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied
the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And what about the other fortnight?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>demanded Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`What about the
other fortnight that you've left me lying here, like a sick rat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
hole?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I couldn't help it, Bill.  I can't go into a long explanation before
company; but I couldn't help it, upon my honour.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Upon your what?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. <div class="bookquote">`Here! Cut me
off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out
of my mouth, or it'll choke me dead.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't be out of temper, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>urged Fagin, submissively. <div class="bookquote">`I have
never forgot you, Bill; never once.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No!  I'll pound it that you han't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, with a bitter grin.
<div class="bookquote">`You've been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid
shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do
that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) got well:
and was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn't been for the
girl, I might have died.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`There now, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word.
<div class="bookquote">`If it hadn't been for the girl!  Who but poor ould Fagin was the means
of your having such a handy girl about you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) says true enough there!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy, coming hastily forward. <div class="bookquote">`Let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) be; let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) be.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>Nancy's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,
receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) with
liquor: of which, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) took very sparingly; while Fagin,
assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a
better temper, by affecting to regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) threats as a little pleasant
banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough
jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
condescended to make.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's all very well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`but I must have some blunt from
you to-night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I haven't a piece of coin about me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then you've got lots at home,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>retorted Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`and I must have some
from there.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Lots!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin, holding up is hands.  <div class="bookquote">`I haven't so much as
would--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know how much you've got, and I dare say you hardly know
yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes;
<div class="bookquote">`but I must have some to-night; and that's flat.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">`I'll send the Artful round
presently.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You won't do nothing of the kind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`The Artful's a
deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) way, or get
dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) up to it.  Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all
sure; and I'll lie down and have a snooze while she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'s gone.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the
amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four
and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would
only leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly
remarking that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) couldn't get any more he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) must accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) home;
with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard.  The
Jew then, taking leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) affectionate friend, returned homeward,
attended by Nancy and the boys:  Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself
on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the
young lady's return.

<p/>In due course, they arrived at Fagin's abode, where they found Toby
Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage,
which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and
with it, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
young friends.  Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found
relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inferior in station and
mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hat
to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Has nobody been, Toby?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>asked Fagin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a living leg,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) collar; <div class="bookquote">`it's
been as dull as swipes.  You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin,
to recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I'm as flat as a
juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn't
had the good natur'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>to amuse this youngster.  Horrid dull, I'm blessed
if I an't!'

<p/>With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit
swept up his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) winnings, and crammed them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) waistcoat pocket with
a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly
beneath the consideration of a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) figure; this done, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that
Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) legs and boots
till they were out of sight, assured the company that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>)
acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>)
didn't value his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) losses the snap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) little finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!'  (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div>said Master Bates, highly amused by this
declaration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Chitling.  <div class="bookquote">`Am I, Fagin?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A very clever fellow, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, patting him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) on the
shoulder, and winking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) other pupils.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an't he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>), Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div>asked Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No doubt at all of that, my dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And it is a creditable thing to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) acquaintance; an't it,
Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div>pursued Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Very much so, indeed, my dear.  They're only jealous, Tom, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
won't give it to them.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div>cried Tom, triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">`that's where it is!  He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has cleaned me
out.  But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can't I, Fagin?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up
your loss at once, and don't lose any more time.  Dodger! Charley!
It's time you were on the lay.  Come!  It's near ten, and nothing done
yet.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their
hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) vivacious friend indulging,
as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in
whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very
conspicuous or peculiar:  inasmuch as there are a great number of
spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr.
Chitling for being seen in good society:  and a great number of fine
gentlemen -LRB-composing the good society aforesaid-RRB- who established their
reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, when they had left the room, <div class="bookquote">`I'll go and get you
that cash, Nancy.  This is only the key of a little cupboard where I
keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear.  I never lock up my money,
for I've got none to lock up, my dear--ha! ha! ha!--none to lock up.
It's a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I'm fond of seeing the
young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.  Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
said, hastily concealing the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) breast; <div class="bookquote">`who's that?  Listen!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl, who was sitting at the table with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms folded, appeared
in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person,
whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was, came or went:  until the murmur of a man's voice
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ears.  The instant she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) caught the sound, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tore off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under
the table. The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) muttered
a complaint of the heat:  in a tone of languor that contrasted, very
remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action:  which,
however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) back towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at
the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bah!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; <div class="bookquote">`it's the
man I expected before; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s coming downstairs.  Not a word about the
money while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s here, Nance.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't stop long.  Not ten minutes, my
dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Laying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skinny forefinger upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lip, the Jew carried a candle to
the door, as a man's step was heard upon the stairs without.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into
the room, was close upon the girl before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>It was Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Only one of my young people,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, observing that Monks drew
back, on beholding a stranger.  <div class="bookquote">`Don't move, Nancy.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of
careless levity, withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) turned towards Fagin, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if
there had been any bystander to observe the change, he (<font color='blue'><b>bystander</b></font>) could hardly
have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Any news?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>inquired Fagin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Great.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And--and--good?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>asked Fagin, hesitating as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) feared to vex
the other man by being too sanguine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not bad, any way,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Monks with a smile.  <div class="bookquote">`I have been prompt
enough this time.  Let me have a word with you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room,
although she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could see that Monks was pointing to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).  The Jew:
perhaps fearing she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might say something aloud about the money, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
endeavoured to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>):  pointed upward, and took Monks out of
the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not that infernal hole we were in before,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could hear the man say
as they went upstairs.  Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did
not reach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
companion to the second story.

<p/>Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the
house, the girl had slipped off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoes; and drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gown loosely
over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head, and muffling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms in it, stood at the door,
listening with breathless interest.  The moment the noise ceased, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and
silence; and was lost in the gloom above.

<p/>The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl
glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards,
the two men were heard descending.  Monks went at once into the street;
and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money.  When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) returned,
the girl was adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, Nance!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nance</b></font>) put down the
candle, <div class="bookquote">`how pale you are!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Pale!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>echoed the girl, shading her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, as if to look
steadily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Nance</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Quite horrible.  What have you been doing to yourself?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don't
know how long and all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl carelessly. <div class="bookquote">`Come!  Let me get
back; that's a dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hand.  They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a
<div class="bookquote">`good-night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>When the girl got into the open street, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat down upon a doorstep;
and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way.  Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite
opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) returned, quickened
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run.  After
completely exhausting herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopped to take breath:  and, as if
suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) inability to do
something she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was bent upon, wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, and burst into tears.

<p/>It might be that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tears relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), or that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt the full
hopelessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) condition; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned back; and hurrying with
nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover
lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own
thoughts:  soon reached the dwelling where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had left the
housebreaker.

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) betrayed any agitation, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) presented herself to Mr. Sikes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had brought the
money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) uttered a growl of
satisfaction, and replacing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head upon the pillow, resumed the
slumbers which her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arrival had interrupted.

<p/>It was fortunate for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that the possession of money occasioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) so
much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal
had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
temper; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had neither time nor inclination to be very critical
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) behaviour and deportment.  That she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had all the abstracted and
nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous
step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would
have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have
taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of
discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than
those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour
towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable
condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>)
demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>), that, had
her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been
very unlikely to have awakened his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) suspicions.

<p/>As that day closed in, the girl's excitement increased; and, when night
came on, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink
himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheek, and a fire
in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.

<p/>Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) glass
towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when
these symptoms first struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, burn my body!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, raising himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stared the girl in the face.  <div class="bookquote">`You look like a corpse come to life
again.  What's the matter?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Matter!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`Nothing.  What do you look at me so hard
for?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What foolery is this?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>demanded Sikes, grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by the arm, and
shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) roughly.  <div class="bookquote">`What is it?  What do you mean?  What are you
thinking of?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Of many things, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, shivering, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did so,
pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes.  <div class="bookquote">`But, Lord!  What odds in that?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed
to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look
which had preceded them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I tell you wot it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`if you haven't caught the fever,
and got it comin'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>on, now, there's something more than usual in the
wind, and something dangerous too.  You're not a-going to--.  No,
damme! you wouldn't do that!'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do what?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There ain't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and muttering the
words to himself; <div class="bookquote">`there ain't a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I'd
have cut her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) throat three months ago.  She (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)'s got the fever coming on;
that's it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the
bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) physic.
The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but
with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>); and held the vessel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lips, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
drank off the contents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>said the robber, <div class="bookquote">`come and sit aside of me, and put on your own
face; or I'll alter it so, that you won't know it agin when you do want
it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl obeyed.  Sikes, locking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), fell back upon the
pillow: turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.  They closed; opened again;
closed once more; again opened.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) position restlessly;
and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as
often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of
rising, into a deep and heavy sleep.  The grasp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand relaxed;
the upraised arm fell languidly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) side; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lay like one in a
profound trance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The laudanum has taken effect at last,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>murmured the girl, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose
from the bedside.  <div class="bookquote">`I may be too late, even now.'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hastily dressed herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bonnet and shawl:  looking fearfully
round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes's heavy hand upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kissed the
robber's lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with
noiseless touch, hurried from the house.

<p/>A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Has it long gone the half-hour?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It'll strike the hour in another quarter,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man: raising his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lantern to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>muttered Nancy:
brushing swiftly past him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and gliding rapidly down the street.

<p/>Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues
through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) tracked her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) way, in making from Spitalfields towards
the West-End of London.  The clock struck ten, increasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)
impatience.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) tore along the narrow pavement:  elbowing the
passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses'
heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly
watching their opportunity to do the like.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The woman is mad!'  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>said the people, turning to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
rushed away.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were
comparatively deserted; and here her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) headlong progress excited a still
greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hurried past.  Some
quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was hastening
at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and looked back,
surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neared her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) place of destination, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was alone.

<p/>It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park.
As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the spot, the clock struck eleven.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had loitered for a few
paces as though irresolute, and making up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind to advance; but the
sound determined her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stepped into the hall.  The porter's seat
was vacant.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced
towards the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, young woman!'  (<font color='red'><b>a female</b></font>)</div>said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a
door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`who do you want here?'

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A lady who is stopping in this house,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>answered the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A lady!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. <div class="bookquote">`What lady?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Miss Maylie,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy.

<p/>The young woman, who had by this time, noted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appearance, replied
only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
To him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Nancy repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) request.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What name am I to say?'  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>asked the waiter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's of no use saying any,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nor business?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, nor that neither,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`I must see the lady.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Come!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) towards the door.  <div class="bookquote">`None of this.
Take yourself off.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I shall be carried out if I go!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl violently; <div class="bookquote">`and I can
make that a job that two of you won't like to do.  Isn't there anybody
here,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, looking round, <div class="bookquote">`that will see a simple message carried
for a poor wretch like me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who
with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward
to interfere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Take it up for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Joe; can't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>this person</b></font>)</div>said this person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the good?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man.  <div class="bookquote">`You don't suppose the young lady
will see such as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); do you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>This allusion to Nancy's doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of
chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great
fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) sex; and strongly
advocated her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do what you like with me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, turning to the men again;
<div class="bookquote">`but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for
God Almighty's sake.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>The soft-hearted cook added his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) intercession, and the result was that
the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's it to be?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, with one foot on the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said
Nancy; <div class="bookquote">`and that if the lady will only hear the first word she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has to
say, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will know whether to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) business, or to have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned
out of doors as an impostor.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said the man, <div class="bookquote">`you're coming it strong!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You give the message,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl firmly; <div class="bookquote">`and let me hear the
answer.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The man ran upstairs.  Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless,
listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn,
of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they
became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman
was to walk upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's no good being proper in this world,'  (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div>said the first housemaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
second.

<p/>The third contented herself with wondering <div class="bookquote">`what ladies was made of' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>;
and the fourth took the first in a quartette of <div class="bookquote">`Shameful!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with which
the Dianas concluded.

<p/>Regardless of all this: for she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) had weightier matters at heart: Nancy
followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber,
lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), and retired.



<p/>CHAPTER XL

<p/>A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER

<p/>The girl's life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most
noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the
woman's original nature left in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard a light
step approaching the door opposite to that by which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had entered,
and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another
moment contain, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt burdened with the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own deep shame,
and shrunk as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could scarcely bear the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had sought this interview.

<p/>But struggling with these better feelings was pride,--the vice of the
lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and
self-assured.  The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the
fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the
jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,--even
this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the
womanly feeling which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought a weakness, but which alone connected
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with that humanity, of which her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasting life had obliterated so
many, many traces when a very child.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which
presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending
them on the ground, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head with affected carelessness as
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's a hard matter to get to see you, lady.  If I had taken offence,
and gone away, as many would have done, you'd have been sorry for it
one day, and not without reason either.'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose.
<div class="bookquote">`Do not think of that.  Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the
person you inquired for.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the
absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl
completely by surprise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, lady, lady!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands passionately before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
face, <div class="bookquote">`if there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,--there
would--there would!'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Sit down,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, earnestly.  <div class="bookquote">`If you are in poverty or affliction
I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,--I shall indeed.  Sit
down.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Let me stand, lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, still weeping, <div class="bookquote">`and do not speak
to me so kindly till you know me better.  It is growing late.
Is--is--that door shut?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance
in case she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) should require it.  <div class="bookquote">`Why?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Because,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, <div class="bookquote">`I am about to put my life and the lives of
others in your hands.  I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to
old Fagin's on the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) went out from the house in Pentonville.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Rose Maylie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I, lady!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`I am the infamous creature you have
heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first
moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets
have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so
help me God!  Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady.  I am younger
than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The
poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What dreadful things are these!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, involuntarily falling from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) strange companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, <div class="bookquote">`that you
had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you
were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness,
and--and--something worse than all--as I have been from my cradle.  I
may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will
be my deathbed.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I pity you!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, in a broken voice.  <div class="bookquote">`It wrings my heart to
hear you!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Heaven bless you for your goodness!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl. <div class="bookquote">`If you knew
what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away
from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to
tell you what I have overheard.  Do you know a man named Monks?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl; <div class="bookquote">`and knew you were here, for it was
by hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tell the place that I found you out.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I never heard the name,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes by some other amongst us,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl, <div class="bookquote">`which I
more than thought before.  Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put
into your house on the night of the robbery, I--suspecting this
man--listened to a conversation held between him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Fagin in the dark.
I found out, from what I heard, that Monks--the man I asked you about,
you know--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, <div class="bookquote">`I understand.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`--That Monks,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>pursued the girl, <div class="bookquote">`had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accidently with two of
our boys on the day we first lost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and had known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directly to be
the same child that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was watching for, though I couldn't make out
why.  A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
should have a certain sum; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was to have more for making him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a
thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`For what purpose?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>asked Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of
finding out,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl people</b></font>)</div>said the girl; <div class="bookquote">`and there are not many people besides me
that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery.  But
I did; and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) no more till last night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl people</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And what occurred then?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll tell you, lady.  Last night he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) came again.  Again they went
upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray
me, again listened at the door.  The first words I heard Monks say were
these:  ``So the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of
the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is
rotting in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coffin.''  They laughed, and talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) success in
doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild,
said that though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had got the young devil's money safely now, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d
rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been
to have brought down the boast of the father's will, by driving him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
through every jail in town, and then hauling him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up for some capital
felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) besides.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What is all this!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl.
<div class="bookquote">`Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to
yours, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could gratify his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hatred by taking the boy's life
without bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own neck in danger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) would; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) couldn't,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'d be upon the watch to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) at every turn in life; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
took advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) birth and history, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) might harm him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) yet. ``In
short, Fagin,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) says, ``Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as
I'll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) brother!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Those were his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) words,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had
scarcely ceased to do, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) began to speak, for a vision of Sikes
haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) perpetually.  <div class="bookquote">`And more. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) spoke of you and the other
lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against
him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), that Oliver should come into your hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) laughed, and said
there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds
of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who
your two-legged spaniel was.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You do not mean,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, turning very pale, <div class="bookquote">`to tell me that this
was said in earnest?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the
girl, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an earnest man when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hatred is up.
I know many who do worse things; but I'd rather listen to them all a
dozen times, than to that Monks once.  It is growing late, and I have
to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as
this.  I must get back quickly.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`But what can I do?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose.  <div class="bookquote">`To what use can I turn this
communication without you?  Back!  Why do you wish to return to
companions you paint in such terrible colors?  If you repeat this
information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the
next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an
hour's delay.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I wish to go back,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`I must go back, because--how can
I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?--because among the men
I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all;
that I can't leave:  no, not even to be saved from the life I am
leading now.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Your having interfered in this dear boy's behalf before,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose;
<div class="bookquote">`your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard;
your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your
evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you
might yet be reclaimed.  Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said the earnest girl, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands
as the tears coursed down her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face, <div class="bookquote">`do not turn a deaf ear to the
entreaties of one of your own sex; the first--the first, I do believe,
who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion.  Do hear
my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, sinking on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) knees, <div class="bookquote">`dear, sweet, angel lady,
you _are_ the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and
if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of
sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It is never too late,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, <div class="bookquote">`for penitence and atonement.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It is,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, writhing in agony of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind; <div class="bookquote">`I cannot leave
him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) now!  I could not be his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) death.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why should you be?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>asked Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing could save him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`If I told others what I
have told you, and led to their being taken, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would be sure to die.
He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is the boldest, and has been so cruel!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Is it possible,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried Rose, <div class="bookquote">`that for such a man as this, you can
resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue?  It is
madness.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know what it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered the girl; <div class="bookquote">`I only know that it is
so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and
wretched as myself.  I must go back.  Whether it is God's wrath for the
wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) through
every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew
that I was to die by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand at last.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What am I to do?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose.  <div class="bookquote">`I should not let you depart from me
thus.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You should, lady, and I know you will,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl, rising.
<div class="bookquote">`You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness,
and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose.
<div class="bookquote">`This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me,
benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a
secret, and advise you what to do,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But where can I find you again when it is necessary?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>asked Rose.  <div class="bookquote">`I
do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will
you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and
come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I
shall not be watched or followed?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I promise you solemnly,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said
the girl without hesitation, <div class="bookquote">`I will walk on London Bridge if I am
alive.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Stay another moment,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly
towards the door.  <div class="bookquote">`Think once again on your own condition, and the
opportunity you have of escaping from it.  You have a claim on me:  not
only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost
almost beyond redemption.  Will you return to this gang of robbers, and
to this man, when a word can save you?  What fascination is it that can
take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery?  Oh! is
there no chord in your heart that I can touch!  Is there nothing left,
to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the
girl steadily, <div class="bookquote">`give away your hearts, love will carry you all
lengths--even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers,
everything, to fill them.  When such as I, who have no certain roof but
the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital
nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fill the place
that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to
cure us?  Pity us, lady--pity us for having only one feeling of the
woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a
comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">`take some money from me, which
may enable you to live without dishonesty--at all events until we meet
again?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a penny,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said
Rose, stepping gently forward.  <div class="bookquote">`I wish to serve you indeed.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You would serve me best, lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands,
<div class="bookquote">`if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think
of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be
something not to die in the hell in which I have lived.  God bless you,
sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought
shame on mine!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away;
while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which
had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank
into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wandering thoughts.



<p/>CHAPTER XLI

<p/>CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE
MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in
which Oliver's history was enveloped, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not but hold sacred the
confidence which the miserable woman with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had just conversed,
had reposed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as a young and guileless girl.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) words and
manner had touched Rose Maylie's heart; and, mingled with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) love for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour,
was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.

<p/>They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing
for some weeks to a distant part of the coast.  It was now midnight of
the first day.  What course of action could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) determine upon, which
could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) postpone
the journey without exciting suspicion?

<p/>Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but
Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's
impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first
explosion of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) indignation, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would regard the instrument of
Oliver's recapture, to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) with the secret, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>)
representations in the girl's behalf could be seconded by no
experienced person.  These were all reasons for the greatest caution
and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie,
whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the
worthy doctor on the subject.  As to resorting to any legal adviser,
even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of,
for the same reason.  Once the thought occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) of seeking
assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last
parting, and it seemed unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back, when--the
tears rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) pursued this train of reflection--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
might have by this time learnt to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>), and to be happier away.

<p/>Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course
and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive
consideration presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) mind; Rose passed a sleepless and
anxious night.  After more communing with herself next day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) arrived
at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If it be painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">`to come back here, how painful
it will be to me!  But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will not come; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) may write, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went away.  I hardly thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would; but it was better for us
both.'   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the
very paper which was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) messenger should not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) weep.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and
had considered and reconsidered the first line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) letter without
writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the
streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such
breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new
cause of alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What makes you look so flurried?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>asked Rose, advancing to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>replied the boy.
<div class="bookquote">`Oh dear!  To think that I should see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at last, and you should be
able to know that I have told you the truth!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose,
soothing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`But what is this?--of whom do you speak?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I have seen the gentleman,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, scarcely able to
articulate, <div class="bookquote">`the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow, that we
have so often talked about.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Where?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>asked Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Getting out of a coach,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight,
<div class="bookquote">`and going into a house.  I didn't speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)--I couldn't speak to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) didn't see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go
up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  But Giles asked, for me, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) lived there, and they
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) did.  Look here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, <div class="bookquote">`here
it is; here's where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lives--I'm going there directly!  Oh, dear me,
dear me!  What shall I do when I come to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) speak
again!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) attention not a little distracted by these and a great many
other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was
Craven Street, in the Strand.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) very soon determined upon turning
the discovery to account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Quick!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) said.  <div class="bookquote">`Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready
to go with me.  I will take you there directly, without a minute's loss
of time.  I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour,
and be ready as soon as you are.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five
minutes they were on their way to Craven Street.  When they arrived
there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the
old gentleman to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and sending up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) card by the servant,
requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business.  The servant
soon returned, to beg that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) would walk upstairs; and following him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman
of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat.  At no great distance
from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and
gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting
with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chin
propped thereupon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Dear me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising
with great politeness, <div class="bookquote">`I beg your pardon, young lady--I imagined it
was some importunate person who--I beg you will excuse me.  Be seated,
pray.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, glancing from the other
gentleman to the one who had spoken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That is my name,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`This is my friend, Mr.
Grimwig.  Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I believe,'  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div>interposed Miss Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`that at this period of our
interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away.
If I am correctly informed, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is cognizant of the business on which I
wish to speak to you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brownlow inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) head.  Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very
stiff bow, and risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) chair, made another very stiff bow, and
dropped into it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Rose, naturally
embarrassed; <div class="bookquote">`but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a
very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest
in hearing of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) again.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oliver Twist you knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) as,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose.

<p/>The words no sooner escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been
affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with
a great crash, and falling back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) chair, discharged from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)
features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged
in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed
so much emotion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) former attitude, and looking out straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) emitted a long
deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air,
but to die away in the innermost recesses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) stomach.

<p/>Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) astonishment was not
expressed in the same eccentric manner.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) chair nearer to
Miss Maylie's, and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the
question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which
nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce
any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once
induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven's name put me in
possession of it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A bad one!  I'll eat my head if he (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) is not a bad one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div>growled Mr.
Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose,
colouring; <div class="bookquote">`and that Power which has thought fit to try him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)
years, has planted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) breast affections and feelings which would do
honour to many who have numbered his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) days six times over.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm only sixty-one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. <div class="bookquote">`And,
as the devil's in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I
don't see the application of that remark.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) does not
mean what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) says.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) does,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Grimwig.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) does not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)'ll eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) head, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) doesn't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Grimwig.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) would deserve to have it knocked off, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) does,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brownlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)'d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>responded Mr.
Grimwig, knocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) stick upon the floor.

<p/>Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and
afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, Miss Maylie,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`to return to the subject in
which your humanity is so much interested.  Will you let me know what
intelligence you have of this poor child:  allowing me to promise that
I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), and that since
I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had
imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) former associates to rob
me, has been considerably shaken.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Rose, who had had time to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) thoughts, at once related, in a
few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) left Mr.
Brownlow's house; reserving Nancy's information for that gentleman's
private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) only sorrow,
for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) former
benefactor and friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Thank God!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`This is great happiness to me,
great happiness.  But you have not told me where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is now, Miss
Maylie.  You must pardon my finding fault with you,--but why not have
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is waiting in a coach at the door,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`At this door!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried the old gentleman.  With which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hurried out of
the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach,
without another word.

<p/>When the room-door closed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), Mr. Grimwig lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) head,
and converting one of the hind legs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) chair into a pivot,
described three distinct circles with the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) stick and
the table; sitting in it all the time.  After performing this
evolution, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) rose and limped as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) could up and down the room
at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) without the slightest preface.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual
proceeding.  <div class="bookquote">`Don't be afraid.  I'm old enough to be your grandfather.
You're a sweet girl.  I like you.  Here they are!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, as he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) threw himself at one dexterous dive into his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) former
seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig
received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had
been the only reward for all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) anxiety and care in Oliver's behalf,
Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell.  <div class="bookquote">`Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.'

 (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and
dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, rather
testily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, that I do, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the old lady.  <div class="bookquote">`People's eyes, at my
time of life, don't improve with age, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I could have told you that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`but put on your
glasses, and see if you can't find out what you were wanted for, will
you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady began to rummage in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pocket for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spectacles. But
Oliver's patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) first impulse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sprang into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`God be good to me!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady, embracing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">`it is my
innocent boy!'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`My dear old nurse!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would come back--I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms.  <div class="bookquote">`How well he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looks, and how like a gentleman's son he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is
dressed again!  Where have you been, this long, long while?  Ah! the
same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad.  I
have never forgotten them or his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) quiet smile, but have seen them every
day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone
since I was a lightsome young creature.'   (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Running on thus, and now
holding Oliver from her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to mark how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had grown, now clasping him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fingers fondly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hair, the good soul
laughed and wept upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) neck by turns.

<p/>Leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led
the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) interview with Nancy, which occasioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) no little surprise
and perplexity.  Rose also explained her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) reasons for not confiding in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance.  The old gentleman
considered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold
solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself.  To afford him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) an
early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged
that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should call at the hotel at eight o'clock that evening, and
that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all
that had occurred.  These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver
returned home.

<p/>Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor's wrath.
Nancy's history was no sooner unfolded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>), than he (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) poured forth a
shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) the
first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff;
and actually put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the
assistance of those worthies.  And, doubtless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) would, in this first
outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment's
consideration of the consequences, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) had not been restrained, in
part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was
himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and
representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
hotbrained purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then what the devil is to be done?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the impetuous doctor, when
they had rejoined the two ladies.  <div class="bookquote">`Are we to pass a vote of thanks to
all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred
pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some
slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not exactly that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; <div class="bookquote">`but we must
proceed gently and with great care.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Gentleness and care,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the doctor.  <div class="bookquote">`I'd send them one and
all to--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Never mind where,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`But reflect whether
sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What object?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Simply, the discovery of Oliver's parentage, and regaining for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) the
inheritance of which, if this story be true, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) has been fraudulently
deprived.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief;
<div class="bookquote">`I almost forgot that.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`placing this poor girl entirely out
of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these
scoundrels to justice without compromising her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) safety, what good should
we bring about?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>suggested the
doctor, <div class="bookquote">`and transporting the rest.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Very good,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; <div class="bookquote">`but no doubt they will
bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step
in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very
Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to
Oliver's, which is the same thing.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`How?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>inquired the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Thus.  It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in
getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man,
Monks, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees.  That can only be done by stratagem, and by
catching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not surrounded by these people.  For, suppose
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were apprehended, we have no proof against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not even -LRB-so
far as we know, or as the facts appear to us-RRB- concerned with the gang
in any of their robberies. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were not discharged, it is very
unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could receive any further punishment than being
committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever
afterwards his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth would be so obstinately closed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might as
well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor impetuously, <div class="bookquote">`I put it to you again, whether
you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be
considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest
intentions, but really--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was about to speak. <div class="bookquote">`The promise
shall be kept.  I don't think it will, in the slightest degree,
interfere with our proceedings.  But, before we can resolve upon any
precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to
ascertain from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will point out this Monks, on the
understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law;
or, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) such an
account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) haunts and description of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) person, as will enable us
to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is
Tuesday.  I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly
quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div><p/>Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving
a delay of five whole days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) was fain to admit that no better course
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very
strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman's proposition was carried
unanimously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I should like,'  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)
is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material
assistance to us; I should say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) was bred a lawyer, and quitted
the Bar in disgust because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) had only one brief and a motion of
course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not,
you must determine for yourselves.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in
mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We must put it to the vote,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`who may he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) be?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That lady's son, and this young lady's--very old friend,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the
doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an
expressive glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) niece.

<p/>Rose blushed deeply, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) did not make any audible objection to this
motion -LRB-possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) felt in a hopeless minority-RRB-; and Harry Maylie and
Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We stay in town, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`while there remains
the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of
success.  I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the
object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to
remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that
any hope remains.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Good!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`And as I see on the faces about me, a
disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to
corroborate Oliver's tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me
stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may
deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story.  Believe
me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite
hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and
disappointments already quite numerous enough.  Come!  Supper has been
announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will
have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) company,
and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forth upon the
world.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, the old gentleman gave his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand to Mrs. Maylie, and
escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) into the supper-room.  Mr. Losberne followed, leading
Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.



<p/>CHAPTER XLII

<p/>AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER'S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS,
BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS

<p/>Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London,
by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that
this history should bestow some attention.

<p/>They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as
a male and female:  for the former was one of those long-limbed,
knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign
any precise age,--looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like
undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys.  The
woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) need have been
to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely
dangled from a stick which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) carried over his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) shoulder, a small parcel
wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough.  This
circumstance, added to the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) legs, which were of unusual
extent, enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in
advance of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) companion, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) occasionally turned with an
impatient jerk of the head:  as if reproaching her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tardiness, and
urging her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to greater exertion.

<p/>Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any
object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider
passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until
they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller
stopped and called impatiently to his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) companion,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come on, can't yer?  What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.'

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's a heavy load, I can tell you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the female</b></font>)</div>said the female, coming up, almost
breathless with fatigue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Heavy!  What are yer talking about?  What are yer made for?'  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>rejoined
the male traveller, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) own little bundle as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) spoke, to the
other shoulder.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain't
enough to tire anybody's patience out, I don't know what is!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Is it much farther?'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>asked the woman, resting herself against a bank,
and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Much farther!  Yer as good as there,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the long-legged tramper,
pointing out before him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`Look there!  Those are the lights of London.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`They're a good two mile off, at least,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman despondingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Never mind whether they're two mile off, or twenty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah
Claypole; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) it was; <div class="bookquote">`but get up and come on, or I'll kick yer, and
so I give yer notice.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As Noah's red nose grew redder with anger, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) crossed the road
while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) threat into execution,
the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)
side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked, after they
had walked a few hundred yards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`How should I know?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably
impaired by walking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Near, I hope,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, not near,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Claypole.  <div class="bookquote">`There!  Not near; so don't
think it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why not?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`When I tell yer that I don't mean to do a thing, that's enough,
without any why or because either,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Claypole with dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, you needn't be so cross,'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A pretty thing it would be, wouldn't it to go and stop at the very
first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) come up
after us, might poke in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) old nose, and have us taken back in a cart
with handcuffs on,'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone.  `No!  I shall
go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop
till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on.
<div class="bookquote">`Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I've got a head; for if we hadn't gone,
at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer'd
have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady.  And serve yer
right for being a fool.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I know I ain't as cunning as you are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Charlotte; <div class="bookquote">`but don't
put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up.  You
would have been if I had been, any way.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Claypole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I took it for you, Noah, dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>rejoined Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Did I keep it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Claypole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you
are,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, chucking him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) under the chin, and drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>).

<p/>This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole's habit to
repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be
observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had trusted Charlotte
to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be
found on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>):  which would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) an opportunity of asserting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chances of
escape.  Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) entered at this juncture, into no explanation of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.

<p/>In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without
halting, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) wisely
judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that
London began in earnest.  Just pausing to observe which appeared the
most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>)
crossed into Saint John's Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of
the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray's Inn Lane and
Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst
that improvement has left in the midst of London.

<p/>Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>); now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole
external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as
some fancied appearance induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) to believe it too public for his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>)
purpose.  At length, he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) stopped in front of one, more humble in
appearance and more dirty than any he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) had yet seen; and, having crossed
over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced
his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) intention of putting up there, for the night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So give us the bundle,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman's
shoulders, and slinging it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) own; <div class="bookquote">`and don't yer speak, except
when yer spoke to.  What's the name of the house--t-h-r--three what?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Cripples,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Three Cripples,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>repeated Noah, <div class="bookquote">`and a very good sign too.  Now, then!
Keep close at my heels, and come along.'   (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>With these injunctions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)
pushed the rattling door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) shoulder, and entered the house,
followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) companion.

<p/>There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) two elbows
on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) stared very hard at
Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).

<p/>If Noah had been attired in his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) charity-boy's dress, there might have
been some reason for the Jew opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes so wide; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had
discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) appearance exciting
so much attention in a public-house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is this the Three Cripples?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Noah.

<p/>`That is the dabe of this <div class="bookquote">`ouse,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country,
recommended us here,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and
perhaps to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to betray no surprise.  <div class="bookquote">`We want to sleep here
to-night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I' (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>b dot certaid you cad,' said Barney, who was the attendant sprite;
<div class="bookquote">`but I'll idquire.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer
while yer inquiring, will yer?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah.

<p/>Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting
the required viands before them; having done which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) informed the
travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable
couple to their refreshment.

<p/>Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps
lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small
curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the
last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only
look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of
being observed -LRB-the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between
which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself-RRB-, but
could, by applying his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable
distinctness, their subject of conversation.  The landlord of the house
had not withdrawn his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) eye from this place of espial for five minutes,
and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above
related, when Fagin, in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) evening's business, came into
the bar to inquire after some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) young pupils.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>said Barney:  <div class="bookquote">`stradegers id the next roob.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Strangers!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>repeated the old man in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!  Ad rub uds too,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>added Barney.  <div class="bookquote">`Frob the cuttry, but subthig in
your way, or I' (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>b bistaked.'

<p/>Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.

<p/>Mounting a stool, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) cautiously applied his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eye to the pane of glass,
from which secret post he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from
the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses
of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>)
pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Aha!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) whispered, looking round to Barney, <div class="bookquote">`I like that fellow's
looks.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>)'d be of use to us; he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) knows how to train the girl already.
Don't make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear 'em
talk--let me hear 'em.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) again applied his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) eye to the glass, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) ear to the
partition, listened attentively:  with a subtle and eager look upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>)
face, that might have appertained to some old goblin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So I mean to be a gentleman,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) legs,
and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had
arrived too late to hear. <div class="bookquote">`No more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a
gentleman's life for me:  and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I should like that well enough, dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Charlotte; <div class="bookquote">`but tills
ain't to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>'Tills be blowed!' said Mr. Claypole; <div class="bookquote">`there's more things besides
tills to be emptied.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Pockets, women's ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Claypole, rising with the porter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But you can't do all that, dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I shall look out to get into company with them as can,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Noah.
<div class="bookquote">`They'll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you
yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and
deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Charlotte,
imprinting a kiss upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) ugly face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There, that'll do:  don't yer be too affectionate, in case I'm cross
with yer,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity.  <div class="bookquote">`I
should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of
'em, and follering 'em about, unbeknown to themselves.  That would suit
me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some
gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound
note you've got,--especially as we don't very well know how to get rid
of it ourselves.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/>After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot
with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents,
nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>)
appeared greatly refreshed.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) was meditating another, when the sudden
opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).

<p/>The stranger was Mr. Fagin.  And very amiable he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) looked, and a very low
bow he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) made, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest
table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>said Fagin,
rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hands.  <div class="bookquote">`From the country, I see, sir?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`How do yer see that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Noah Claypole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We have not so much dust as that in London,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, pointing
from Noah's shoes to those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) companion, and from them to the two
bundles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yer a sharp feller,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`Ha! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew,
sinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) voice to a confidential whisper; <div class="bookquote">`and that's the truth.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
right forefinger,--a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though
not with complete success, in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) own nose not being
large enough for the purpose.  However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret
the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) opinion, and
put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly
manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Good stuff that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`A man need be always emptying a till, or a
pocket, or a woman's reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) drinks it regularly.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) own remarks than he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>)
fell back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a
countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't mind me, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) chair closer. <div class="bookquote">`Ha!
ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very
lucky it was only me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I didn't take it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) legs
like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) could
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) chair; <div class="bookquote">`it was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) doing; yer've got it now, Charlotte,
yer know yer have.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No matter who's got it, or who did it, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin,
glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk's eye at the girl and the two
bundles.  <div class="bookquote">`I'm in that way myself, and I like you for it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`In what way?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`In that way of business,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>rejoined Fagin; <div class="bookquote">`and so are the people of
the house.  You've hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe
here as you could be.  There is not a safer place in all this town than
is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so.  And I have taken
a fancy to you and the young woman; so I've said the word, and you may
make your minds easy.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Noah Claypole's mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) body certainly was not; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) shuffled and writhed about, into
various uncouth positions:  eyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) new friend meanwhile with
mingled fear and suspicion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll tell you more,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had reassured the girl, by
dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. <div class="bookquote">`I have got a friend
that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right
way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think
will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>inquired Fagin,
shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) shoulders.  <div class="bookquote">`Here!  Let me have a word with you outside.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`There's no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, getting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) legs by gradual degrees abroad again. <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)'ll take the luggage
upstairs the while.  Charlotte, see to them bundles.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed
without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) way off
with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s kept tolerably well under, ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) asked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) resumed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) seat:  in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Quite perfect,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>rejoined Fagin, clapping him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) on the shoulder. <div class="bookquote">`You're
a genius, my dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, I suppose if I wasn't, I shouldn't be here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah. <div class="bookquote">`But,
I say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'ll be back if yer lose time.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, what do you think?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`If you was to like my friend,
could you do better than join him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) in a good way of business; that's where it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>responded Noah,
winking one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) little eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best
society in the profession.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Regular town-maders?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Claypole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not a countryman among 'em; and I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>)'d take you, even on
my recommendation, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) didn't run rather short of assistants just
now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Should I have to hand over?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) breeches-pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It couldn't possibly be done without,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, in a most
decided manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Twenty pound, though--it's a lot of money!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not when it's in a note you can't get rid of,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>retorted Fagin. <div class="bookquote">`Number
and date taken, I suppose?  Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah!  It's not
worth much to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>).  It'll have to go abroad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) couldn't sell it
for a great deal in the market.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`When could I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Noah doubtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`To-morrow morning.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Where?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Here.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Um!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`What's the wages?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Live like a gentleman--board and lodging, pipes and spirits free--half
of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Mr.
Fagin.

<p/>Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least
comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) recollected
that, in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) refusal, it was in the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) new
acquaintance to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) up to justice immediately -LRB-and more unlikely
things had come to pass-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) gradually relented, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) thought
that would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`But, yer see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>observed Noah, <div class="bookquote">`as she (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) will be able to do a good deal,
I should like to take something very light.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A little fancy work?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>suggested Fagin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah! something of that sort,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`What do you think would
suit me now?  Something not too trying for the strength, and not very
dangerous, you know.  That's the sort of thing!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my
dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`My friend wants somebody who would do that well,
very much.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, I did mention that, and I shouldn't mind turning my hand to it
sometimes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; <div class="bookquote">`but it wouldn't pay by
itself, you know.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That's true!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.
<div class="bookquote">`No, it might not.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you think, then?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Noah, anxiously regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">`Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not
much more risk than being at home.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you think of the old ladies?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>asked Fagin. <div class="bookquote">`There's a good
deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running
round the corner.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Noah,
shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) head.  <div class="bookquote">`I don't think that would answer my purpose.  Ain't
there any other line open?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Stop!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hand on Noah's knee.  <div class="bookquote">`The kinchin lay.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Claypole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The kinchins, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`is the young children that's sent
on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay
is just to take their money away--they've always got it ready in their
hands,--then knock 'em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if
there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt
itself.  Ha! ha! ha!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) legs in an ecstasy.
<div class="bookquote">`Lord, that's the very thing!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`To be sure it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin; <div class="bookquote">`and you can have a few good beats
chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like
that, where they're always going errands; and you can upset as many
kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>With this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a
burst of laughter both long and loud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, that's all right!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) had recovered himself, and
Charlotte had returned.  <div class="bookquote">`What time to-morrow shall we say?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Will ten do?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent,
<div class="bookquote">`What name shall I tell my good friend.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Mr. Bolter,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such
emergency.  <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Morris Bolter.  This is Mrs. Bolter.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Bolter's humble servant,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, bowing with grotesque
politeness.  <div class="bookquote">`I hope I shall know her (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) better very shortly.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>thundered Mr. Claypole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, Noah, dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bolter</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Morris
Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`You understand?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh yes, I understand--perfectly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, telling the truth for
once.  <div class="bookquote">`Good-night!  Good-night!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) way. Noah
Claypole, bespeaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) good lady's attention, proceeded to enlighten
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) relative to the arrangement he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) had made, with all that haughtiness
and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex,
but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on
the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.



<p/>CHAPTER XLIII

<p/>WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Mr.
Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into
between them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) had removed next day to Fagin's house.  ''Cod, I
thought as much last night!'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Every man's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own friend, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) most
insinuating grin.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hasn't as good a one as himself anywhere.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Except sometimes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of
the world.  <div class="bookquote">`Some people are nobody's enemies but their own, yer know.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't believe that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`When a man's his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own enemy, it's
only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s too much his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own friend; not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s careful for
everybody but himself.  Pooh! pooh!  There ain't such a thing in
nature.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`There oughn't to be, if there is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bolter.

<p/>`That stands to reason.  Some conjurers say that number three is the
magic number, and some say number seven.  It's neither, my friend,
neither.  It's number one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bolter.  <div class="bookquote">`Number one for ever.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`In a little community like ours, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, who felt it
necessary to qualify this position, <div class="bookquote">`we have a general number one,
without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, the devil!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bolter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, <div class="bookquote">`we
are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must
be so.  For instance, it's your object to take care of number
one--meaning yourself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bolter.  <div class="bookquote">`Yer about right there.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well!  You can't take care of yourself, number one, without taking
care of me, number one.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Number two, you mean,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with
the quality of selfishness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, I don't!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>retorted Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`I'm of the same importance to you, as
you are to yourself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mr. Bolter, <div class="bookquote">`yer a very nice man, and I'm very
fond of yer; but we ain't quite so thick together, as all that comes
to.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Only think,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) shoulders, and stretching out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hands; <div class="bookquote">`only consider.  You've done what's a very pretty thing, and
what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the
cravat round your throat, that's so very easily tied and so very
difficult to unloose--in plain English, the halter!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bolter put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) neckerchief, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) felt it
inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not
in substance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The gallows,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>continued Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`the gallows, my dear, is an ugly
finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has
stopped many a bold fellow's career on the broad highway.  To keep in
the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with
you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bolter.  <div class="bookquote">`What do yer talk about such
things for?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Only to show you my meaning clearly,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
eyebrows.  <div class="bookquote">`To be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my
little business all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number
one, the second my number one.  The more you value your number one, the
more careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you
at first--that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must
do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That's true,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh! yer a cunning
old codger!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) powers was no
mere compliment, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had really impressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) recruit with a
sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) wily genius, which it was most important that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) should
entertain in the outset of their acquaintance.  To strengthen an
impression so desirable and useful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) followed up the blow by
acquainting him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter's
respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with
a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under
heavy losses,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`My best hand was taken from me, yesterday
morning.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You don't mean to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) died?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bolter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`not so bad as that.  Not quite so bad.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Wanted,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>interposed Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was wanted.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Very particular?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Bolter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`not very.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was charged with attempting to pick
a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>),--his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own, my dear,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) took snuff himself, and was very fond of it.  They
remanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner.  Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
was worth fifty boxes, and I'd give the price of as many to have him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
back.  You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known
the Dodger.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, but I shall know him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>), I hope; don't yer think so?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bolter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm doubtful about it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, with a sigh.  <div class="bookquote">`If they don't
get any fresh evidence, it'll only be a summary conviction, and we
shall have him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it's
a case of lagging.  They know what a clever lad he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'ll be a
lifer.  They'll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Bolter. <div class="bookquote">`What's
the good of talking in that way to me; why don't yer speak so as I can
understand yer?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the
vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been
informed that they represented that combination of words,
<div class="bookquote">`transportation for life,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>when the dialogue was cut short by the entry
of Master Bates, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) breeches-pockets, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) face
twisted into a look of semi-comical woe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's all up, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) new companion had
been made known to each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you mean?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>`They've found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more's a
coming to <div class="bookquote">`dentify him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); and the Artful's booked for a passage out,'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied Master Bates.  <div class="bookquote">`I must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and
a hatband, to wisit him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) in, afore he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) sets out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) travels.  To
think of Jack Dawkins--lummy Jack--the Dodger--the Artful Dodger--going
abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box!  I never thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)'d a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest.
Oh, why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) rob some rich old gentleman of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) walables, and
go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour
nor glory!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>With this expression of feeling for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) unfortunate friend, Master
Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and
despondency.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) having neither honour nor glory for!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) pupil. <div class="bookquote">`Wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) always
the top-sawyer among you all!  Is there one of you that could touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
or come near him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) on any scent!  Eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div>replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret;
<div class="bookquote">`not one.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then what do you talk of?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin angrily; <div class="bookquote">`what are you
blubbering for?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>''Cause it isn't on the rec-ord, is it?' said Charley, chafed into
perfect defiance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) venerable friend by the current of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) regrets;
''cause it can't come out in the <div class="bookquote">`dictment; 'cause nobody will never
know half of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was.  How will he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) stand in the Newgate Calendar?
P'raps not be there at all.  Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!'

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin, extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) right hand, and turning to Mr.
Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) had the
palsy; <div class="bookquote">`see what a pride they take in their profession, my dear.  Ain't
it beautiful?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of
Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to
that young gentleman and patted him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on the shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Never mind, Charley,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin soothingly; <div class="bookquote">`it'll come out, it'll be
sure to come out.  They'll all know what a clever fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll
show it himself, and not disgrace his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) old pals and teachers.  Think how
young he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is too!  What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) time
of life!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, it is a honour that is!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley, a little consoled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) shall have all he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) wants,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>continued the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) shall be kept in
the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman.  Like a gentleman!  With his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
beer every day, and money in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket to pitch and toss with, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
can't spend it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, shall he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) though?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>cried Charley Bates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ay, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) shall,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`and we'll have a big-wig, Charley:
one that's got the greatest gift of the gab:  to carry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) defence;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) shall make a speech for himself too, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) likes; and we'll read
it all in the papers--``Artful Dodger--shrieks of laughter--here the

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div>laughed Master Bates, <div class="bookquote">`what a lark that would be, wouldn't
it, Fagin?  I say, how the Artful would bother 'em wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Would!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) shall--he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) will!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah, to be sure, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>repeated Charley, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I think I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) eyes upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) pupil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`So do I,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>cried Charley Bates.  <div class="bookquote">`Ha! ha! ha! so do I.  I see it all
afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin.  What a game!  What a regular game!
All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of
'em as intimate and comfortable as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) was the judge's own son making
a speech arter dinner--ha! ha! ha!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) young friend's eccentric
disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to
consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now
looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and
exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of
displaying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) abilities.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We must know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`Let me think.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Shall I go?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>asked Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not for the world,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`Are you mad, my dear, stark mad,
that you'd walk into the very place where--No, Charley, no. One is
enough to lose at a time.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You don't mean to go yourself, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley with a
humorous leer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That wouldn't quite fit,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then why don't you send this new cove?'  (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div>asked Master Bates, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
hand on Noah's arm.  <div class="bookquote">`Nobody knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) didn't mind--'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>observed Fagin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Mind!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>interposed Charley.  <div class="bookquote">`What should he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) have to mind?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Really nothing, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, <div class="bookquote">`really
nothing.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>observed Noah, backing towards
the door, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) head with a kind of sober alarm.  <div class="bookquote">`No,
no--none of that.  It's not in my department, that ain't.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Wot department has he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) got, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div>inquired Master Bates, surveying
Noah's lank form with much disgust.  <div class="bookquote">`The cutting away when there's
anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there's everything
right; is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) branch?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Never mind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Bolter; <div class="bookquote">`and don't yer take liberties with
yer superiors, little boy, or yer'll find yerself in the wrong shop.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it
was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office;
that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had
engaged, nor any description of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) person, had yet been forwarded to
the metropolis, it was very probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was not even suspected of
having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) were properly
disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to visit as any in
London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could be supposed likely to resort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own free will.

<p/>Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much
greater degree by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented,
with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin's
directions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) immediately substituted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own attire, a waggoner's
frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings:  all of which articles
the Jew had at hand.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was likewise furnished with a felt hat well
garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter's whip.  Thus equipped,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent
Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
curiousity; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow
as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) would look the part to
perfection.

<p/>These arrangements completed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was informed of the necessary signs
and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by
Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short
distance of Bow Street. Having described the precise situation of the
office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was to walk
straight up the passage, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) got into the side, and pull off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) went into the room, Charley Bates bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hurry on
alone, and promised to bide his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) return on the spot of their parting.

<p/>Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually
followed the directions he (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) had received, which--Master Bates being
pretty well acquainted with the locality--were so exact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was
enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question,
or meeting with any interruption by the way.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who
were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which
was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the
prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in
the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful
locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed
the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine -LRB-if they
could-RRB- the full majesty of justice.

<p/>There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to
their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a
couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the
table.  A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>)
nose listlessly with a large key, except when he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) repressed an undue
tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or
looked sternly up to bid some woman <div class="bookquote">`Take that baby out,'  (<font color='red'><b>some woman</b></font>)</div>when the
gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the
mother's shawl, from some meagre infant.  The room smelt close and
unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling
blackened.  There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a
dusty clock above the dock--the only thing present, that seemed to go
on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance
with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less
unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that
frowned upon it.

<p/>Noah looked eagerly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) for the Dodger; but although there were
several women who would have done very well for that distinguished
character's mother or sister, and more than one man who might be
supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, nobody at all
answering the description given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>)
waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women,
being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly
relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) felt at once
could be no other than the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) visit.

<p/>It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big
coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) left hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) pocket, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>)
hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait
altogether indescribable, and, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) place in the dock, requested
in an audible voice to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) was placed in that `ere disgraceful
sitivation for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>said the jailer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm an Englishman, ain't I?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>rejoined the Dodger.  <div class="bookquote">`Where are my
priwileges?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You'll get your privileges soon enough,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>retorted the jailer, <div class="bookquote">`and
pepper with 'em.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`We'll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to
say to the beaks, if I don't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawkins/Mr. John Dawkins/John</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Dawkins.  <div class="bookquote">`Now then!  Wot is
this here business?  I shall thank the madg`strates to dispose of this
here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for
I've got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man
of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll go away if I
ain't there to my time, and then pr`aps ther won't be an action for
damage against them as kep me away.  Oh no, certainly not!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><p/>At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a
view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to
communicate <div class="bookquote">`the names of them two files as was on the bench.'   (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>Which
so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as
Master Bates could have done if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had heard the request.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Silence there!'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>cried the jailer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What is this?'  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrates</b></font>)</div>inquired one of the magistrates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A pick-pocketing case, your worship.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the magistrates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Has the boy ever been here before?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ought to have been, a many times,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>replied the jailer. <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) has been
pretty well everywhere else.  _I_ know him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) well, your worship.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh! you know me, do you?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the Artful, making a note of the
statement.  <div class="bookquote">`Wery good.  That's a case of deformation of character, any
way.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now then, where are the witnesses?'  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah! that's right,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>added the Dodger.  <div class="bookquote">`Where are they?  I should like
to see 'em.'

 (<font color='red'><b>a policeman</b></font>)</div><p/>This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward
who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in
a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very
old one, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) deliberately put back again, after trying it on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own
countenance.  For this reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took the Dodger into custody as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) could get near him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>), and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) person a silver snuff-box, with the owner's name engraved upon the
lid.  This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court
Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had missed it on the previous day, the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had also
remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrate</b></font>)</div>said the magistrate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I wouldn't abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with
him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrate</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Have you anything to say at all?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) worship ask if you've anything to say?'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>inquired the
jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) elbow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I beg your pardon,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, looking up with an air of
abstraction.  <div class="bookquote">`Did you redress yourself to me, my man?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,'
 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>observed the officer with a grin.  <div class="bookquote">`Do you mean to say anything, you
young shaver?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger, `not here, for this ain't the shop for
justice:  besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning
with the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have
something to say elsewhere, and so will he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), and so will a wery numerous
and <div class="bookquote">`spectable circle of acquaintance as'll make them beaks wish they'd
never been born, or that they'd got their footmen to hang 'em up to
their own hat-pegs, afore they let 'em come out this morning to try it
on upon me.  I'll--'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`There!  He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)'s fully committed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>interposed the clerk. <div class="bookquote">`Take him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) away.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Come on,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>said the jailer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh ah!  I'll come on,'  (<font color='red'><b>Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger, brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hat with the
palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hand.  <div class="bookquote">`Ah! -LRB-to the Bench-RRB- it's no use your looking
frightened; I won't show you no mercy, not a ha`porth of it.  _You'll_
pay for this, my fine fellers.  I wouldn't be you for something!  I
wouldn't go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask
me.  Here, carry me off to prison!  Take me away!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><p/>With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the
collar; threatening, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) got into the yard, to make a parliamentary
business of it; and then grinning in the officer's face, with great
glee and self-approval.

<p/>Having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the
best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) way back to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) had left Master Bates. After waiting
here some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) was joined by that young gentleman, who had
prudently abstained from showing himself until he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) had looked carefully
abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) new friend had not
been followed by any impertinent person.

<p/>The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news
that the Dodger was doing full justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) bringing-up, and
establishing for himself a glorious reputation.



<p/>CHAPTER XLIV

<p/>THE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE. SHE
FAILS.

<p/>Adept as she (<font color='blue'><b>NANCY</b></font>) was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the
girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of
the step she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had taken, wrought upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) mind.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) remembered that
both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) schemes,
which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)
was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion.  Vile as those
schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) feelings towards Fagin, who had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), step by step, deeper and
deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape;
still, there were times when, even towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) felt some
relenting, lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) disclosure should bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) within the iron grasp
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had so long eluded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) should fall at last--richly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) merited
such a fate--by her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hand.

<p/>But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach
itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix
itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by
any consideration.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) fears for Sikes would have been more powerful
inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had stipulated
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) secret should be rigidly kept, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had dropped no clue which
could lead to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) discovery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had refused, even for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) sake, a
refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)--and
what more could she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) do! She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was resolved.

<p/>Though all her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they
forced themselves upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), again and again, and left their traces too.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) grew pale and thin, even within a few days.  At times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) took no
heed of what was passing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), or no part in conversations where
once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) would have been the loudest.  At other times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) laughed
without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards--she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) sat
silent and dejected, brooding with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hands, while the
very effort by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) roused herself, told, more forcibly than even
these indications, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was ill at ease, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) thoughts were
occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the
course of discussion by her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) companions.

<p/>It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the
hour.  Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen.  The
girl looked up from the low seat on which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) crouched, and listened
too.  Eleven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`An hour this side of midnight,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, raising the blind to look
out and returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) seat.  <div class="bookquote">`Dark and heavy it is too. A good night
for business this.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there's none
quite ready to be done.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You're right for once,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes gruffly.  <div class="bookquote">`It is a pity, for I'm
in the humour too.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin sighed, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head despondingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We must make up for lost time when we've got things into a good train.
That's all I know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's the way to talk, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, venturing to pat him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
on the shoulder.  <div class="bookquote">`It does me good to hear you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Does you good, does it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Well, so be it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>laughed Fagin, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) were relieved by even this
concession.  <div class="bookquote">`You're like yourself to-night, Bill.  Quite like
yourself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my
shoulder, so take it away,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, casting off the Jew's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It make you nervous, Bill,--reminds you of being nabbed, does it?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, determined not to be offended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>returned Sikes. `There never
was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father,
and I suppose _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ is singeing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grizzled red beard by this time,
unless you came straight from the old <div class="bookquote">`un without any father at all
betwixt you; which I shouldn't wonder at, a bit.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin offered no reply to this compliment:  but, pulling Sikes by the
sleeve, pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of
the foregoing conversation to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) bonnet, and was now leaving
the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hallo!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Nance.  Where's the gal going to at this time
of night?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not far.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What answer's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>retorted Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Do you hear me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know where,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then I do,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had any real objection to the girl going where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) listed.
<div class="bookquote">`Nowhere.  Sit down.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'm not well.  I told you that before,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`I want a
breath of air.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Put your head out of the winder,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There's not enough there,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`I want it in the street.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then you won't have it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes.  With which assurance he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) rose,
locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bonnet from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
head, flung it up to the top of an old press.  <div class="bookquote">`There,'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>said the
robber.  <div class="bookquote">`Now stop quietly where you are, will you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl
turning very pale.  <div class="bookquote">`What do you mean, Bill?  Do you know what you're
doing?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Know what I'm--Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
senses, you know, or she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) daren't talk to me in that way.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You'll drive me on the something desperate,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>muttered the girl placing
both hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) breast, as though to keep down by force some
violent outbreak.  <div class="bookquote">`Let me go, will you,--this minute--this instant.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to let me go, Fagin.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had better.  It'll be better for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).  Do you hear me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>cried Nancy stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) foot upon the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hear you!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>repeated Sikes turning round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) chair to confront her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">`Aye!  And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have
such a grip on your throat as'll tear some of that screaming voice out.
Wot has come over you, you jade!  Wot is it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Let me go,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself
down on the floor, before the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`Bill, let me go; you
don't know what you are doing. You don't, indeed.  For only one
hour--do--do!'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Cut my limbs off one by one!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) roughly by the
arm, <div class="bookquote">`If I don't think the gal's stark raving mad.  Get up.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not till you let me go--not till you let me go--Never--never!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>screamed the girl.  Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), struggling
and wrestling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) by the way, into a small room adjoining, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into a chair, held her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
down by force.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) struggled and implored by turns until twelve
o'clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest
the point any further.  With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make
no more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to recover at
leisure and rejoined Fagin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Whew!'  (<font color='red'><b>the housebreaker</b></font>)</div>said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">`Wot a precious strange gal that is!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You may say that, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin thoughtfully.  <div class="bookquote">`You may say
that.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Wot did she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) take it into her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) head to go out to-night for, do you
think?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>asked Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Come; you should know her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) better than me. Wot
does it mean?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Obstinacy; woman's obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, I suppose it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`I thought I had tamed her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>),
but she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)'s as bad as ever.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Worse,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin thoughtfully.  <div class="bookquote">`I never knew her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) like this, for
such a little cause.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nor I,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`I think she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)'s got a touch of that fever in her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)
blood yet, and it won't come out--eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Like enough.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll let her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)'s
took that way again,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.

<p/>Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched
on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself
aloof,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`We was poor too, all the time, and I think, one
way or other, it's worried and fretted her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>); and that being shut up here
so long has made her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) restless--eh?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That's it, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew in a whisper.  <div class="bookquote">`Hush!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
former seat.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes were swollen and red; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rocked herself to and
fro; tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s on the other tack!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of
excessive surprise on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) companion.

<p/>Fagin nodded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to take no further notice just then; and, in a few
minutes, the girl subsided into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) accustomed demeanour. Whispering
Sikes that there was no fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) relapsing, Fagin took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hat
and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) good-night.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) paused when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) reached the room-door, and
looking round, asked if somebody would light him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) down the dark stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Light him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) down,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, who was filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pipe. <div class="bookquote">`It's a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
should break his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers.  Show
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) a light.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle.  When they
reached the passage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lip, and drawing close
to the girl, said, in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What is it, Nancy, dear?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, in the same tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The reason of all this,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`If _he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)_' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) pointed with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) skinny fore-finger up the stairs--`is so hard with you -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s a
brute, Nance, a brute-beast-RRB-, why don't you--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nance</b></font>)</div>said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) mouth almost touching
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ear, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes looking into hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No matter just now.  We'll talk of this again.  You have a friend in
me, Nance; a staunch friend.  I have the means at hand, quiet and
close.  If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog--like a
dog!  worse than his (<font color='blue'><b>Nance</b></font>) dog, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Nance</b></font>) humours him (<font color='blue'><b>Nance</b></font>) sometimes--come to me.  I
say, come to me.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Nance</b></font>) is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of
old, Nance.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I know you well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, without manifesting the least
emotion.  <div class="bookquote">`Good-night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hand on hers, but said
good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) parting look
with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.

<p/>Fagin walked towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) home, intent upon the thoughts that were
working within his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) brain.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had conceived the idea--not from what had
just passed though that had tended to confirm him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), but slowly and by
degrees--that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker's brutality, had
conceived an attachment for some new friend.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) altered manner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)
repeated absences from home alone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) comparative indifference to the
interests of the gang for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had once been so zealous, and,
added to these, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) desperate impatience to leave home that night at a
particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
at least, almost matter of certainty.  The object of this new liking
was not among his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) myrmidons.  He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would be a valuable acquisition with
such an assistant as Nancy, and must -LRB-thus Fagin argued-RRB- be secured
without delay.

<p/>There was another, and a darker object, to be gained.  Sikes knew too
much, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the
wounds were hidden.  The girl must know, well, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
off, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could never be safe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) fury, and that it would be surely
wreaked--to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life--on the
object of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more recent fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`With a little persuasion,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>thought Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`what more likely than that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would consent to poison him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)?  Women have done such things, and
worse, to secure the same object before now.  There would be the
dangerous villain:  the man I hate:  gone; another secured in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime
to back it, unlimited.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
sat alone, in the housebreaker's room; and with them uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), of
sounding the girl in the broken hints he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) threw out at parting.  There
was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to
understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) meaning.  The girl clearly comprehended it.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) glance
at parting showed _that_.

<p/>But perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and
that was one of the chief ends to be attained. <div class="bookquote">`How,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>thought Fagin, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) crept homeward, <div class="bookquote">`can I increase my influence with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?  What new
power can I acquire?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Such brains are fertile in expedients.  If, without extracting a
confession from herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) laid a watch, discovered the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes -LRB-of
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood in no common fear-RRB- unless she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) designs,
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) not secure her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) compliance?

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I can,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, almost aloud.  <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) durst not refuse me then.  Not
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life, not for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life!  I have it all.  The means are ready,
and shall be set to work.  I shall have you yet!'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards
the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had left the bolder villain; and went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) way:
busying his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) bony hands in the folds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) tattered garment, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
wrenched tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) grasp, as though there were a hated enemy
crushed with every motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) fingers.



<p/>CHAPTER XLV

<p/>NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION

<p/>The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for
the appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new associate, who after a delay that seemed
interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious
assault on the breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bolter,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite
Morris Bolter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, here I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>returned Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`What's the matter?  Don't yer ask
me to do anything till I have done eating. That's a great fault in this
place.  Yer never get time enough over yer meals.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You can talk as you eat, can't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, cursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) dear
young friend's greediness from the very bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh yes, I can talk.  I get on better when I talk,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, cutting
a monstrous slice of bread.  <div class="bookquote">`Where's Charlotte?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Out,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`I sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) out this morning with the other young
woman, because I wanted us to be alone.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`I wish yer'd ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to make some buttered toast
first.  Well.  Talk away.  Yer won't interrupt me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/>There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)
had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of
business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You did well yesterday, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`Beautiful!  Six
shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day!  The kinchin
lay will be a fortune to you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bolter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, my dear.  The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the
milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Pretty well, I think, for a beginner,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>remarked Mr. Bolter
complacently.  <div class="bookquote">`The pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was
standing by itself outside a public-house.  I thought it might get
rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer know.  Eh?  Ha! ha! ha!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>)
laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) first hunk
of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I want you, Bolter,'  (<font color='red'><b>hunk</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, leaning over the table, <div class="bookquote">`to do a
piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>rejoined Bolter, <div class="bookquote">`don't yer go shoving me into danger, or
sending me any more o'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>yer police-offices. That don't suit me, that
don't; and so I tell yer.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's not the smallest danger in it--not the very smallest,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the
Jew; <div class="bookquote">`it's only to dodge a woman.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`An old woman?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Bolter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`A young one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I can do that pretty well, I know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Bolter.  <div class="bookquote">`I was a regular
cunning sneak when I was at school.  What am I to dodge her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for?  Not
to--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not to do anything, but to tell me where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goes, who she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sees, and,
if possible, what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says; to remember the street, if it is a street,
or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the
information you can.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What'll yer give me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Noah, setting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) cup, and looking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) employer, eagerly, in the face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If you do it well, a pound, my dear.  One pound,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, wishing
to interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) in the scent as much as possible.  <div class="bookquote">`And that's what I
never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn't valuable
consideration to be gained.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>inquired Noah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`One of us.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh Lor!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>cried Noah, curling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) nose.  <div class="bookquote">`Yer doubtful of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), are
yer?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they
are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`Just to have the pleasure of knowing them, if
they're respectable people, eh?  Ha! ha! ha! I'm your man.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I knew you would be,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin, elated by the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
proposal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah.  <div class="bookquote">`Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)? Where am I to
wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?  Where am I to go?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`All that, my dear, you shall hear from me.  I'll point her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) out at the
proper time,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div><p/>That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and
equipped in his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) carter's dress:  ready to turn out at a word from
Fagin.  Six nights passed--six long weary nights--and on each, Fagin
came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was
not yet time.  On the seventh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) returned earlier, and with an
exultation he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could not conceal.  It was Sunday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) goes abroad to-night,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`and on the right errand, I'm
sure; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) has been alone all day, and the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) is afraid of will
not be back much before daybreak.  Come with me. Quick!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of
such intense excitement that it infected him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).  They left the house
stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at
length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) had slept, on the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) arrival in London.

<p/>It was past eleven o'clock, and the door was closed.  It opened softly
on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise;
and the door was closed behind them.

<p/>Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words,
Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of
glass to Noah, and signed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) to climb up and observe the person in
the adjoining room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is that the woman?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) asked, scarcely above his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) breath.

<p/>Fagin nodded yes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I can't see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>whispered Noah.  `She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is looking down, and
the candle is behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stay there,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>whispered Fagin.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) signed to Barney, who withdrew.  In
an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of
snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking
to the girl, caused her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>cried the spy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Plainly?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I should know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) among a thousand.'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out.
Fagin drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) behind a small partition which was curtained off, and
they held their breaths as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) passed within a few feet of their place
of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hist!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad who held the door.  <div class="bookquote">`Dow.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/>Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`To the left,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>whispered the lad; <div class="bookquote">`take the left had, and keep od the
other side.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl's retreating
figure, already at some distance before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) advanced as near as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the
better to observe her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) motions. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked nervously round, twice or
thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), pass on.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to gather courage as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) advanced, and to
walk with a steadier and firmer step.  The spy preserved the same
relative distance between them, and followed:  with his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) eye upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XLVI

<p/>THE APPOINTMENT KEPT

<p/>The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures
emerged on London Bridge.  One, which advanced with a swift and rapid
step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as though in
quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who
slunk along in the deepest shadow he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could find, and, at some distance,
accommodated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pace to hers:  stopping when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stopped:  and as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
moved again, creeping stealthily on:  but never allowing himself, in
the ardour of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursuit, to gain upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) footsteps.  Thus, they
crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the
woman, apparently disappointed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anxious scrutiny of the
foot-passengers, turned back.  The movement was sudden; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), was not thrown off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guard by it; for, shrinking into
one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning
over the parapet the better to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) figure, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to
pass on the opposite pavement. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was about the same distance in
advance as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been before, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slipped quietly down, and followed
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stopped.  The man
stopped too.

<p/>It was a very dark night.  The day had been unfavourable, and at that
hour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were,
hurried quickly past:  very possibly without seeing, but certainly
without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in view.
Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards
of such of London's destitute population, as chanced to take their way
over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless
hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence:  neither
speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.

<p/>A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that
burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and
rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks.
The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull
from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water
too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old
Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the
giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the
forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of
churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.

<p/>The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro--closely watched
meanwhile by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hidden observer--when the heavy bell of St. Paul's
tolled for the death of another day.  Midnight had come upon the
crowded city.  The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse:
the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face
of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child:  midnight was upon them
all.

<p/>The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by
a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a
short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked
straight towards it.  They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement,
when the girl started, and immediately made towards them.

<p/>They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who
entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of
being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate.
They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it
immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close
up--brushed against them, indeed--at that precise moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">`I am afraid to speak to you here.
Come away--out of the public road--down the steps yonder!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) uttered these words, and indicated, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hand, the direction
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and
roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.

<p/>The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the
Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour's
Church, form a landing-stairs from the river.  To this spot, the man
bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after
a moment's survey of the place, he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) began to descend.

<p/>These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights.
Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the
left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames.
At this point the lower steps widen:  so that a person turning that
angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs
who chance to be above him (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>), if only a step. The countryman looked
hastily round, when he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) reached this point; and as there seemed no
better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty
of room, he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) slipped aside, with his (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) back to the pilaster, and there
waited:  pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if
he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) could not hear what was said, he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) could follow them again, with
safety.

<p/>So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the
spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>)
had been led to expect, that he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) more than once gave the matter up for
lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or
had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious
conversation.  He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) was on the point of emerging from his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) hiding-place,
and regaining the road above, when he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) heard the sound of footsteps, and
directly afterwards of voices almost close at his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) ear.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely
breathing, listened attentively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is far enough,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said a voice, which was evidently that of the
gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther.  Many
people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but
you see I am willing to humour you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`To humour me!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the voice of the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had followed.
<div class="bookquote">`You're considerate, indeed, sir.  To humour me!  Well, well, it's no
matter.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, for what,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in a kinder tone, <div class="bookquote">`for what purpose
can you have brought us to this strange place?  Why not have let me
speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something
stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I told you before,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy, <div class="bookquote">`that I was afraid to speak to you
there.  I don't know why it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said the girl, shuddering, <div class="bookquote">`but I have
such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A fear of what?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I scarcely know of what,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`I wish I did. Horrible
thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that
has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day.  I was
reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things
came into the print.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Imagination,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, soothing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No imagination,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl in a hoarse voice. <div class="bookquote">`I'll swear I saw
``coffin'' written in every page of the book in large black
letters,--aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets
to-night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`There is nothing unusual in that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`They have
passed me often.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`_Real ones_,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`This was not.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the listener</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something so uncommon in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manner, that the flesh of the
concealed listener crept as he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) heard the girl utter these words, and
the blood chilled within him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) had never experienced a greater
relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) begged
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such
fearful fancies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kindly,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">`Poor
creature!  She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seems to need it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me
as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the
girl.  <div class="bookquote">`Oh, dear lady, why ar'n't those who claim to be God's own folks
as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth,
and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud
instead of so much humbler?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`A Turk turns his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) face, after washing it
well, to the East, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) says his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) prayers; these good people, after
giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles
off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven.
Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were
perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover
herself.  The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You were not here last Sunday night,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I couldn't come,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy; <div class="bookquote">`I was kept by force.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`By whom?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that I told the young lady of before.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on
the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asked the old
gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head.  <div class="bookquote">`It's not very easy for me
to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) unless he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows why; I couldn't give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a drink of
laudanum before I came away.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Did he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) awake before you returned?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>inquired the gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No; and neither he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nor any of them suspect me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Good,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`Now listen to me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am ready,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) paused for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the gentleman began, <div class="bookquote">`has communicated to me, and to
some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nearly
a fortnight since.  I confess to you that I had doubts, at first,
whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe
you are.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl earnestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I repeat that I firmly believe it.  To prove to you that I am disposed
to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the
secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks.  But
if--if--'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cannot be secured, or, if secured,
cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, recoiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That man must be delivered up by you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I will not do it!  I will never do it!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. <div class="bookquote">`Devil that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) is, and worse than devil as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) has been to me, I will never do that.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You will not?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this
answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Never!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>returned the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Tell me why?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`For one reason,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl firmly, <div class="bookquote">`for one reason, that the
lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will, for I have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
promise:  and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has
led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the
same courses together, and I'll not turn upon them, who might--any of
them--have turned upon me, but didn't, bad as they are.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
had been aiming to attain; <div class="bookquote">`put Monks into my hands, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to
me to deal with.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turns against the others?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),
there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver's
little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye,
and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And if it is not?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>suggested the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>pursued the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`this Fagin shall not be brought to
justice without your consent.  In such a case I could show you reasons,
I think, which would induce you to yield it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Have I the lady's promise for that?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You have,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose.  <div class="bookquote">`My true and faithful pledge.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl,
after a short pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Never,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`The intelligence should be brought to
bear upon him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could never even guess.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the
girl after another interval of silence, <div class="bookquote">`but I will take your words.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>After receiving an assurance from both, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might safely do so,
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the
listener to discover even the purport of what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, to describe, by
name and situation, the public-house whence she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been followed that
night.  From the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) occasionally paused, it appeared
as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
communicated.  When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had thoroughly explained the localities of the
place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting
observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the
habit of frequenting it, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to consider for a few moments, for
the purpose of recalling his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) features and appearances more forcibly to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) recollection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is tall,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl man stout</b></font>)</div>said the girl, <div class="bookquote">`and a strongly made man, but not stout;
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a lurking walk; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walks, constantly looks over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don't forget that,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes are sunk in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head so much deeper than any other man's,
that you might almost tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by that alone.  His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face is dark, like
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair and eyes; and, although he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't be more than six or eight and
twenty, withered and haggard. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips are often discoloured and
disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has desperate fits, and
sometimes even bites his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and covers them with wounds--why did you
start?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl man stout</b></font>)</div>said the girl, stopping suddenly.

<p/>The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not conscious
of having done so, and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to proceed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Part of this,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, <div class="bookquote">`I have drawn out from other people at
the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) twice, and both times
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was covered up in a large cloak.  I think that's all I can give you
to know him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) by.  Stay though,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) added.  <div class="bookquote">`Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) throat:  so high
that you can see a part of it below his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) neckerchief when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turns his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
face:  there is--'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried the gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`How's this?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`You know him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they
were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I think I do,'  (<font color='red'><b>the listener</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, breaking silence.  <div class="bookquote">`I should by
your description.  We shall see.  Many people are singularly like each
other.  It may not be the same.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman silence</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell
from the distinctness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mutter, <div class="bookquote">`It must be he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, returning:  so it seemed by the sound:  to the spot
where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had stood before, <div class="bookquote">`you have given us most valuable assistance,
young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to
serve you?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You will not persist in saying that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>rejoined the gentleman, with a
voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder
and more obdurate heart. <div class="bookquote">`Think now.  Tell me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl, weeping.  <div class="bookquote">`You can do nothing to
help me.  I am past all hope, indeed.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You put yourself beyond its pale,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`The past has
been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such
priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never
grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it
is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must
come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you
fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the
compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before
the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of
day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your
former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind
you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment.  Come!  I
would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion,
or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is
pestilence and death to you.  Quit them all, while there is time and
opportunity!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will be persuaded now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the young lady.  <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hesitates, I
am sure.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I fear not, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No sir, I do not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, after a short struggle.  <div class="bookquote">`I am
chained to my old life.  I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave
it.  I must have gone too far to turn back,--and yet I don't know, for
if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it
off.  But,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, looking hastily round, <div class="bookquote">`this fear comes over me
again.  I must go home.'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Home!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Home, lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`To such a home as I have raised for
myself with the work of my whole life.  Let us part. I shall be watched
or seen.  Go!  Go!  If I have done you any service all I ask is, that
you leave me, and let me go my way alone.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It is useless,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, with a sigh.  <div class="bookquote">`We compromise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
safety, perhaps, by staying here.  We may have detained her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) longer than
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expected already.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>urged the girl. <div class="bookquote">`You have.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the young lady, <div class="bookquote">`can be the end of this poor creature's
life!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>repeated the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`Look before you, lady.  Look at that dark
water.  How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the
tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them.  It may
be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at
last.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do not speak thus, pray,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>returned the young lady, sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors
should!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`Good-night, good-night!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentleman turned away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This purse,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the young lady.  <div class="bookquote">`Take it for my sake, that you may
have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl.  <div class="bookquote">`I have not done this for money.  Let me have
that to think of.  And yet--give me something that you have worn:  I
should like to have something--no, no, not a ring--your gloves or
handkerchief--anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you,
sweet lady.  There.  Bless you!  God bless you. Good-night, good-night!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some
discovery which would subject her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to ill-usage and violence, seemed to
determine the gentleman to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) requested.

<p/>The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.

<p/>The two figures of the young lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion soon afterwards
appeared upon the bridge.  They stopped at the summit of the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Hark!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the young lady, listening.  <div class="bookquote">`Did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) call!  I thought I
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, my love,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has not
moved, and will not till we are gone.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/>Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),
and led her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), with gentle force, away.  As they disappeared, the girl
sunk down nearly at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) full length upon one of the stone stairs, and
vented the anguish of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart in bitter tears.

<p/>After a time she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended
the street.  The astonished listener remained motionless on his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) post
for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious
glances round him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) was again alone, crept slowly from his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>)
hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in
the same manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) had descended.

<p/>Peeping out, more than once, when he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) reached the top, to make sure that
he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) utmost speed, and
made for the Jew's house as fast as his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) legs would carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XLVII

<p/>FATAL CONSEQUENCES

<p/>It was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn
of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets
are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and
profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still
and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) old lair, with face so
distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) looked less
like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and
worried by an evil spirit.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) side.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) right hand was raised to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) lips, and as, absorbed
in thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hit his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) long black nails, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) disclosed among his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog's or rat's.

<p/>Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep.
Towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) the old man sometimes directed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes for an instant, and
then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt
wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon
the table, plainly showed that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts were busy elsewhere.

<p/>Indeed they were.  Mortification at the overthrow of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) notable
scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and
utter distrust of the sincerity of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) refusal to yield him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up; bitter
disappointment at the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) revenge on Sikes; the fear of
detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by
all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close
upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain
of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
heart.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) sat without changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) attitude in the least, or appearing to take
the smallest heed of time, until his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) quick ear seemed to be attracted
by a footstep in the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`At last,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) muttered, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) dry and fevered mouth. <div class="bookquote">`At last!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The bell rang gently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) spoke.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) crept upstairs to the door, and
presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who
carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) said, laying the bundle on the table.  <div class="bookquote">`Take care of that,
and do the most you can with it.  It's been trouble enough to get; I
thought I should have been here, three hours ago.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard,
sat down again without speaking.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) did not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes off the
robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over
against each other, face to face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) looked fixedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
lips quivering so violently, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) face so altered by the emotions
which had mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) chair, and surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) with a look of real affright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Wot now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Wot do you look at a man so for?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) right hand, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) trembling forefinger in the
air; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the
moment gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Damme!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) breast with a look of alarm. <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s
gone mad.  I must look to myself here.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>rejoined Fagin, finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) voice.  <div class="bookquote">`It's not--you're not the
person, Bill.  I've no--no fault to find with you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, you haven't, haven't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, looking sternly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), and
ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket.  <div class="bookquote">`That's
lucky--for one of us.  Which one that is, don't matter.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I've got that to tell you, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) chair
nearer, <div class="bookquote">`will make you worse than me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Aye?'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>returned the robber with an incredulous air.  <div class="bookquote">`Tell away! Look
sharp, or Nance will think I'm lost.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Lost!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) has pretty well settled that, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) own
mind, already.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew's face,
and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) coat collar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) huge hand and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) soundly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Speak, will you!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">`or if you don't, it shall be for want of
breath.  Open your mouth and say wot you've got to say in plain words.
Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Suppose that lad that's laying there--'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>Fagin began.

<p/>Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had not
previously observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) said, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) former position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Suppose that lad,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>pursued Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`was to peach--to blow upon us
all--first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having
a meeting with 'em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe
every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be
most easily taken.  Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was to do all this, and besides to blow
upon a plant we've all been in, more or less--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own fancy; not
grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on
bread and water,--but of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own fancy; to please his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own taste;
stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and
peaching to them.  Do you hear me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes flashing
with rage.  <div class="bookquote">`Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) did all this, what then?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What then!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath.  <div class="bookquote">`If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was left
alive till I came, I'd grind his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) skull under the iron heel of my boot
into as many grains as there are hairs upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What if I did it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin almost in a yell.  <div class="bookquote">`I, that knows so
much, and could hang so many besides myself!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth and turning white at
the mere suggestion.  `I'd do something in the jail that <div class="bookquote">`ud get me put
in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I'd fall upon you with
them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. I
should have such strength,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>muttered the robber, poising his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) brawny
arm, <div class="bookquote">`that I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over
it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You would?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Would I!'  (<font color='red'><b>the housebreaker</b></font>)</div>said the housebreaker.  <div class="bookquote">`Try me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't care who,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes impatiently.  <div class="bookquote">`Whoever it was, I'd
serve them the same.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to be silent,
stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>).  Sikes leant forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) chair:  looking on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hands upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and
preparation was to end in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bolter, Bolter!  Poor lad!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, looking up with an expression
of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis.
<div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s tired--tired with watching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) so long,--watching for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)_,
Bill.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Wot d'ye mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>asked Sikes, drawing back.

<p/>Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
into a sitting posture.  When his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) assumed name had been repeated
several times, Noah rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked
sleepily about him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Tell me that again--once again, just for him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) to hear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew,
pointing to Sikes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Tell yer what?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That about-- _Nancy_,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if
to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) leaving the house before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had heard enough. <div class="bookquote">`You
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`To London Bridge?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Where she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) met two people.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`So she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) did.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A gentleman and a lady that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had gone to of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) own accord before,
who asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) to give up all her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) pals, and Monks first, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)
did--and to describe him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) did--and to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) what house it
was that we meet at, and go to, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) did--and where it could be
best watched from, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) did--and what time the people went there,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) did.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) did all this.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) told it all every word without a
threat, without a murmur--she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) did--did she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin, half mad
with fury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`All right,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah, scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) head.  <div class="bookquote">`That's just what it
was!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What did they say, about last Sunday?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`About last Sunday!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah, considering.  <div class="bookquote">`Why I told yer that

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Again.  Tell it again!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin, tightening his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) grasp on Sikes,
and brandishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`They asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) grew more wakeful, seemed to
have a dawning perception who Sikes was, <div class="bookquote">`they asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) didn't

 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why--why?  Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) that.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`What more of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had told

 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hell's fire!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew.  <div class="bookquote">`Let me
go!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Flinging the old man from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rushed from the room, and darted,
wildly and furiously, up the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bill, Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin, following him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hastily.  <div class="bookquote">`A word. Only a
word.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was
unable to open the door:  on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was expending fruitless oaths and
violence, when the Jew came panting up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Let me out,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes.  <div class="bookquote">`Don't speak to me; it's not safe. Let me
out, I say!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hear me speak a word,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>rejoined Fagin, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hand upon the lock.
<div class="bookquote">`You won't be--'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You won't be--too--violent, Bill?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see
each other's faces.  They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire
in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I mean,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) felt all disguise was now
useless, <div class="bookquote">`not too violent for safety.  Be crafty, Bill, and not too
bold.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had
turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.

<p/>Without one pause, or moment's consideration; without once turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
head to the right or left, or raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes to the sky, or lowering
them to the ground, but looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) with savage
resolution:  his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw
seemed starting through his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) skin; the robber held on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) headlong
course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
own door.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the
stairs; and entering his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own room, double-locked the door, and lifting
a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.

<p/>The girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had roused her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
sleep, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) raised herself with a hurried and startled look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Get up!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It is you, Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)
return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It is,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply.  <div class="bookquote">`Get up.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the
candlestick, and hurled it under the grate.  Seeing the faint light of
early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Let it be,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`There's enough
light for wot I've got to do.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, <div class="bookquote">`why do you look like
that at me!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The robber sat regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils
and heaving breast; and then, grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by the head and throat,
dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the
door, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) heavy hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bill, Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal
fear,--`I--I won't scream or cry--not once--hear me--speak to me--tell
me what I have done!'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You know, you she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) devil!'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>returned the robber, suppressing his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) breath.
<div class="bookquote">`You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl, clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have
the heart to kill me.  Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one
night, for you.  You _shall_ have time to think, and save yourself this
crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off.  Bill, Bill,
for dear God's sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my
blood!  I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man struggled violently, to release his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms; but those of the girl
were clasped round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and tear her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not tear
them away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, striving to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) breast, <div class="bookquote">`the
gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some
foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace.  Let
me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy
and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far
apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in
prayers, and never see each other more. It is never too late to repent.
They told me so--I feel it now--but we must have time--a little, little
time!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) pistol. The certainty
of immediate detection if he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) fired, flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mind even in the
midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) fury; and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) beat it twice with all the force he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could
summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) staggered and fell:  nearly blinded with the blood that rained down
from a deep gash in her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty,
on her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) knees, drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) bosom a white handkerchief--Rose Maylie's
own--and holding it up, in her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) folded hands, as high towards Heaven as
her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
Maker.

<p/>It was a ghastly figure to look upon.  The murderer staggering backward
to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) hand, seized a heavy
club and struck her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) down.



<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII

<p/>THE FLIGHT OF SIKES

<p/>Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed
within wide London's bounds since night hung over it, that was the
worst.  Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning
air, that was the foulest and most cruel.

<p/>The sun--the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new
life, and hope, and freshness to man--burst upon the crowded city in
clear and radiant glory.  Through costly-coloured glass and
paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed
its equal ray.  It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay.
It did.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to shut it out, but it would stream in.  If the sight
had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all
that brilliant light!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not moved; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been afraid to stir.  There had been a moan
and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had struck
and struck again.  Once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw a rug over it; but it was worse to
fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), than to see them
glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that
quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had plucked it
off again.  And there was the body--mere flesh and blood, no more--but
such flesh, and so much blood!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There
was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder,
and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney.  Even that frightened
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sturdy as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held the weapon till it broke, and then
piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) washed
himself, and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes; there were spots that would not be
removed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cut the pieces out, and burnt them.  How those stains
were dispersed about the room!  The very feet of the dog were bloody.

<p/>All this time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, never once, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back upon the corpse; no,
not for a moment.  Such preparations completed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved, backward,
towards the door:  dragging the dog with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), lest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should soil his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing
was visible from the outside.  There was the curtain still drawn, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have opened to admit the light she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never saw again.  It lay
nearly under there.  _He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ knew that.  God, how the sun poured down upon
the very spot!

<p/>The glance was instantaneous.  It was a relief to have got free of the
room.  He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which
stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate
Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the
right again, almost as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) began to descend it; and taking the
foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on
Hampstead Heath.  Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>)
mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the
villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of
the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) laid himself
down under a hedge, and slept.

<p/>Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) was up again, and away,--not far into the country, but back
towards London by the high-road--then back again--then over another
part of the same ground as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) already traversed--then wandering up and
down in fields, and lying on ditches' brinks to rest, and starting up
to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.

<p/>Where could he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat
and drink?  Hendon.  That was a good place, not far off, and out of
most people's way.  Thither he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) steps,--running sometimes,
and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail's pace,
or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick.  But
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) got there, all the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) met--the very children at the
doors--seemed to view him (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) with suspicion.  Back he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) turned again,
without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) had tasted no
food for many hours; and once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) lingered on the Heath, uncertain
where to go.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the
old place.  Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane,
and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round,
and still lingered about the same spot.  At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) got away, and
shaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) course for Hatfield.

<p/>It was nine o'clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the
dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the
hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little
street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided
them to the spot.  There was a fire in the tap-room, and some
country-labourers were drinking before it.

<p/>They made room for the stranger, but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sat down in the furthest
corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) dog:  to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
cast a morsel of food from time to time.

<p/>The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the
neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted,
upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous
Sunday; the young men present considering him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very old, and the old men
present declaring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have been quite young--not older, one
white-haired grandfather said, than he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was--with ten or fifteen year of
life in him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) at least--if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had taken care; if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had taken care.

<p/>There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The
robber, after paying his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>)
corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) was half wakened by the
noisy entrance of a new comer.

<p/>This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who
travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors,
washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap
perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) carried in a case
slung to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back.  His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) entrance was the signal for various homely
jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
supper, and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) box of treasures, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ingeniously contrived
to unite business with amusement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`And what be that stoof?  Good to eat, Harry?'  (<font color='red'><b>a countryman</b></font>)</div>asked a grinning
countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This,'  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow composition</b></font>)</div>said the fellow, producing one, <div class="bookquote">`this is the infallible and
invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt,
mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen,
cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or
woollen stuff.  Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains,
paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with
the infallible and invaluable composition.  If a lady stains her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
honour, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has only need to swallow one cake and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s cured at
once--for it's poison.  If a gentleman wants to prove this, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has only
need to bolt one little square, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has put it beyond question--for
it's quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier
in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it.  One penny a
square.  With all these virtues, one penny a square!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the fellow composition</b></font>)</div><p/>There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly
hesitated.  The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's all bought up as fast as it can be made,'  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>said the fellow. <div class="bookquote">`There
are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery,
always a-working upon it, and they can't make it fast enough, though
the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned
directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a
premium of fifty for twins.  One penny a square!  Two half-pence is all
the same, and four farthings is received with joy.  One penny a square!
Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains,
pitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains!  Here is a stain upon the hat
of a gentleman in company, that I'll take clean out, before he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can
order me a pint of ale.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes starting up.  <div class="bookquote">`Give that back.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll take it clean out, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, winking to the company,
<div class="bookquote">`before you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, observe
the dark stain upon this gentleman's hat, no wider than a shilling, but
thicker than a half-crown.  Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain,
beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or
blood-stain--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew
the table, and tearing the hat from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), burst out of the house.

<p/>With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was
not followed, and that they most probably considered him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) some drunken
sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of
the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking
past, when he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was
standing at the little post-office.  He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) almost knew what was to come;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) crossed over, and listened.

<p/>The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. A man,
dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a
basket which lay ready on the pavement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's for your people,'  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>said the guard.  `Now, look alive in there,
will you.  Damn that <div class="bookquote">`ere bag, it warn't ready night afore last; this
won't do, you know!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Anything new up in town, Ben?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the game-keeper, drawing back to
the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No, nothing that I knows on,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, pulling on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gloves.
<div class="bookquote">`Corn's up a little.  I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields
way, but I don't reckon much upon it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh, that's quite true,'  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>said a gentleman inside, who was looking out
of the window.  <div class="bookquote">`And a dreadful murder it was.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Was it, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>rejoined the guard, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) hat.  <div class="bookquote">`Man or woman,
pray, sir?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`A woman,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the gentleman.  <div class="bookquote">`It is supposed--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, Ben,'  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>replied the coachman impatiently.

<p/>`Damn that <div class="bookquote">`ere bag,'  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>said the guard; <div class="bookquote">`are you gone to sleep in there?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Coming!'  (<font color='red'><b>the office keeper</b></font>)</div>cried the office keeper, running out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Coming,'  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>growled the guard.  `Ah, and so's the young <div class="bookquote">`ooman of
property that's going to take a fancy to me, but I don't know when.
Here, give hold.  All ri--ight!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the coach</b></font>)</div><p/>The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.

<p/>Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where
to go.  At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) went back again, and took the road which leads
from Hatfield to St. Albans.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) went on doggedly; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) left the town behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>), and plunged
into the solitude and darkness of the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) felt a dread and awe
creeping upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) which shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) to the core. Every object before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>),
substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some
fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that
haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) of that morning's ghastly figure following at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) heels.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the
outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>)
could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of
wind came laden with that last low cry.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) stopped it did the same.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) ran, it followed--not running too:  that would have been a
relief:  but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and
borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.

<p/>At times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat
this phantom off, though it should look him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) dead; but the hair rose on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) blood stood still, for it had turned with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) and was
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) then.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had kept it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) that morning, but it was
behind now--always.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) back against a bank, and felt that
it stood above him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>), visibly out against the cold night-sky.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) threw
himself upon the road--on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) back upon the road.  At his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) head it
stood, silent, erect, and still--a living grave-stone, with its epitaph
in blood.

<p/>Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence
must sleep.  There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long
minute of that agony of fear.

<p/>There was a shed in a field he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed, that offered shelter for the
night.  Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it
very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stretched
himself close to the wall--to undergo new torture.

<p/>For now, a vision came before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as constant and more terrible than
that from which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had escaped.  Those widely staring eyes, so
lustreless and so glassy, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had better borne to see them than
think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in
themselves, but giving light to nothing.  There were but two, but they
were everywhere.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shut out the sight, there came the room with
every well-known object--some, indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have forgotten, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone over its contents from memory--each in its accustomed
place.  The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw them
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stole away.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up, and rushed into the field without.  The
figure was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once
more.  The eyes were there, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had laid himself along.

<p/>And here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained in such terror as none but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can know, trembling
in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when
suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting,
and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder.  Any sound of men
in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm,
was something to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regained his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength and energy at the
prospect of personal danger; and springing to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, rushed into the
open air.

<p/>The broad sky seemed on fire.  Rising into the air with showers of
sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting
the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the
direction where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood.  The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled
the roar, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing
of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames
as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though
refreshed by food.  The noise increased as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked.  There were
people there--men and women--light, bustle.  It was like new life to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) darted onward--straight, headlong--dashing through brier and
brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dog, who careered
with loud and sounding bark before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came upon the spot.  There were half-dressed figures tearing to and
fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables,
others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others
coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks,
and the tumbling down of red-hot beams.  The apertures, where doors and
windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls
rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron
poured down, white hot, upon the ground.  Women and children shrieked,
and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers.  The
clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water
as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar.  He (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>)
shouted, too, till he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself,
plunged into the thickest of the throng.  Hither and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) dived
that night:  now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the
smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and
men were thickest.  Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of
buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) weight, under
the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire
was he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise,
nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke
and blackened ruins remained.

<p/>This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the
dreadful consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) crime.  He (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) looked suspiciously about him (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>),
for the men were conversing in groups, and he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) feared to be the subject
of their talk.  The dog obeyed the significant beck of his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) finger, and
they drew off, stealthily, together.  He (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) passed near an engine where
some men were seated, and they called to him (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) to share in their
refreshment.  He (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) took some bread and meat; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) drank a draught of
beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the
murder.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) has gone to Birmingham, they say,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said one:  <div class="bookquote">`but they'll
have him (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there'll
be a cry all through the country.'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) hurried off, and walked till he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) almost dropped upon the ground; then
lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep.  He (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>)
wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the
fear of another solitary night.

<p/>Suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) took the desperate resolution to going back to London.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`There's somebody to speak to there, at all event,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">`A good
hiding-place, too.  They'll never expect to nab me there, after this
country scent.  Why can't I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt
from Fagin, get abroad to France?  Damme, I'll risk it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least
frequented roads began his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) journey back, resolved to lie concealed
within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by
a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had
fixed on for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) destination.

<p/>The dog, though.  If any description of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) were out, it would not be
forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>).
This might lead to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) apprehension as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) passed along the streets.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
resolved to drown him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), and walked on, looking about for a pond:
picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) handkerchief as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) went.

<p/>The animal looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) master's face while these preparations
were making; whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) instinct apprehended something of their
purpose, or the robber's sidelong look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was sterner than
ordinary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and
cowered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) came more slowly along.  When his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) master halted at the
brink of a pool, and looked round to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) stopped outright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you hear me call?  Come here!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes.

<p/>The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped
to attach the handkerchief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) throat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) uttered a low growl and
started back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Come back!'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>said the robber.

<p/>The dog wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) tail, but moved not.  Sikes made a running noose and
called him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) again.

<p/>The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
hardest speed.

<p/>The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the
expectation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) would return.  But no dog appeared, and at length
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) journey.



<p/>CHAPTER XLIX

<p/>MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET.  THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE
INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT

<p/>The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow
alighted from a hackney-coach at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) own door, and knocked softly.  The
door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed
himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been
seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side.  At a
sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
between them, hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the house. This man was Monks.

<p/>They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr.
Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. At the door of
this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance,
stopped.  The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for
instructions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows the alternative,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Browlow.  <div class="bookquote">`If he (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) hesitates or
moves a finger but as you bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>), drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) into the street, call for
the aid of the police, and impeach him (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) as a felon in my name.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`How dare you say this of me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`How dare you urge me to it, young man?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow,
confronting him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) with a steady look.  <div class="bookquote">`Are you mad enough to leave this
house?  Unhand him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).  There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow.
But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant
will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery.  I am
resolute and immoveable.  If you are determined to be the same, your
blood be upon your own head!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by
these dogs?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who
stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`By mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`Those persons are indemnified by me.
If you complain of being deprived of your liberty--you had power and
opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it
advisable to remain quiet--I say again, throw yourself for protection
on the law.  I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too
far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have
passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf
into which you rushed, yourself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides.  He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You will decide quickly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and
composure.  <div class="bookquote">`If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign
you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a
shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the
way.  If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those
you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair.
It has waited for you two whole days.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You will be prompt,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`A word from me, and the
alternative has gone for ever.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Still the man hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I have not the inclination to parley,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`and, as I
advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Is there--'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,--`is there--no
middle course?'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`None.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the
room, and, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shoulders, sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Lock the door on the outside,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants,
<div class="bookquote">`and come when I ring.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the attendants</b></font>)</div><p/>The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is pretty treatment, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, throwing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hat and
cloak, <div class="bookquote">`from my father's oldest friend.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It is because I was your father's oldest friend, young man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>returned
Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy
years were bound up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), and that fair creature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) blood and
kindred who rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) God in youth, and left me here a solitary,
lonely man:  it is because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knelt with me beside his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only sisters'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>death-bed when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was yet a boy, on the morning that would--but Heaven
willed otherwise--have made her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) my young wife; it is because my seared
heart clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), from that time forth, through all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trials and
errors, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died; it is because old recollections and associations
filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts
of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you
gently now--yes, Edward Leeford, even now--and blush for your
unworthiness who bear the name.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What has the name to do with it?'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>asked the other, after
contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the
agitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leeford</b></font>) companion.  <div class="bookquote">`What is the name to me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`nothing to you.  But it was _hers_,
and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the
glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a
stranger.  I am very glad you have changed it--very--very.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`This is all mighty fine,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks -LRB-to retain his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) assumed
designation-RRB- after a long silence, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had jerked himself
in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`But what do you want with me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You have a brother,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself:  <div class="bookquote">`a brother,
the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the
street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither,
in wonder and alarm.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I have no brother,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Monks.  <div class="bookquote">`You know I was an only child.
Why do you talk to me of brothers?  You know that, as well as I.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Attend to what I do know, and you may not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">`I
shall interest you by and by.  I know that of the wretched marriage,
into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all
ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole
and most unnatural issue.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't care for hard names,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh.
<div class="bookquote">`You know the fact, and that's enough for me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`But I also know,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>pursued the old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`the misery, the slow
torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. I know how
listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their
heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both.  I know how
cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave
place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last
they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space
apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death
could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest
looks they could assume.  Your mother succeeded; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forgot it soon.
But it rusted and cankered at your father's heart for years.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, they were separated,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, <div class="bookquote">`and what of that?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`When they had been separated for some time,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Brownlow,
<div class="bookquote">`and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had
utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) junior, who,
with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fell among new
friends.  This circumstance, at least, you know already.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not I,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, turning away his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes and beating his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) foot upon
the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. <div class="bookquote">`Not I.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never
forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>returned Mr.
Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than
eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty--for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was, I
repeat, a boy, when _his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ father ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to marry. Must I go back
to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will
you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I have nothing to disclose,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>rejoined Monks.  <div class="bookquote">`You must talk on if you
will.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`These new friends, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`were a naval officer
retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year
before, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) with two children--there had been more, but, of
all their family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters;
one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two
or three years old.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What's this to me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`They resided,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the
interruption, <div class="bookquote">`in a part of the country to which your father in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wandering had repaired, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) abode.
Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your
father was gifted as few men are.  He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sister's soul and person.
As the old officer knew him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) more and more, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) grew to love him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).  I
would that it had ended there.  His (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) daughter did the same.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lips, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes
fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) immediately resumed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The end of a year found him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) contracted, solemnly contracted, to that
daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a
guileless girl.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Your tale is of the longest,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>observed Monks, moving restlessly in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>returned
Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed
joy and happiness, it would be very brief.  At length one of those rich
relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had
been sacrificed, as others are often--it is no uncommon case--died, and
to repair the misery he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been instrumental in occasioning, left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) panacea for all griefs--Money.  It was necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should
immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and
where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had died, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affairs in great confusion.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went;
was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the
intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
died the day after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arrival, leaving no will--_no will_--so that the
whole property fell to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>At this part of the recital Monks held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath, and listened with a
face of intense eagerness, though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were not directed towards
the speaker.  As Mr. Brownlow paused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) position with the
air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hot face
and hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) went abroad, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) passed through London on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) way,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) eyes upon the other's face,
<div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) came to me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I never heard of that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear
incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture--a
portrait painted by himself--a likeness of this poor girl--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) did
not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hasty
journey.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked
in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself;
confided to me his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) intention to convert his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) whole property, at any
loss, into money, and, having settled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) wife and you a portion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) recent acquisition, to fly the country--I guessed too well he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) would
not fly alone--and never see it more.  Even from me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) old and early
friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that
covered one most dear to both--even from me he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) withheld any more
particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after
that to see me once again, for the last time on earth. Alas!  _That_
was the last time.  I had no letter, and I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) more.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I went,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, <div class="bookquote">`I went, when all was
over, to the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)--I will use the term the world would freely
use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child
should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).  The
family had left that part a week before; they had called in such
trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place
by night.  Why, or whither, none can tell.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Monks drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of
triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`When your brother,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other's
chair, <div class="bookquote">`When your brother:  a feeble, ragged, neglected child:  was
cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a
life of vice and infamy--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>cried Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`By me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`I told you I should interest you before
long.  I say by me--I see that your cunning associate suppressed my
name, although for ought he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) knew, it would be quite strange to your
ears.  When he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from
sickness in my house, his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) strong resemblance to this picture I have
spoken of, struck me with astonishment.  Even when I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) in
all his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) face
that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in
a vivid dream.  I need not tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) was snared away before I knew
his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) history--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Because you know it well.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Denial to me is vain,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`I shall show you that I
know more than that.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You--you--can't prove anything against me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>stammered Monks.  <div class="bookquote">`I defy
you to do it!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`We shall see,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>returned the old gentleman with a searching glance.  <div class="bookquote">`I
lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).  Your mother
being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody
could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate
in the West Indies--whither, as you well know, you retired upon your
mother's death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here--I
made the voyage.  You had left it, months before, and were supposed to
be in London, but no one could tell where.  I returned.  Your agents
had no clue to your residence.  You came and went, they said, as
strangely as you had ever done:  sometimes for days together and
sometimes not for months:  keeping to all appearance the same low
haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your
associates when a fierce ungovernable boy.  I wearied them with new
applications.  I paced the streets by night and day, but until two
hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an
instant.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And now you do see me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, rising boldly, <div class="bookquote">`what then? Fraud
and robbery are high-sounding words--justified, you think, by a fancied
resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man's Brother!
You don't even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you
don't even know that.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I _did not_,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; <div class="bookquote">`but within the last
fortnight I have learnt it all.  You have a brother; you know it, and
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).  There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret
and the gain to you at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own death.  It contained a reference to some
child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was
born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were
first awakened by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) resemblance to your father.  You repaired to the
place of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) birth. There existed proofs--proofs long suppressed--of
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) birth and parentage.  Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now,
in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, ''_the only proofs of the
boy's identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that
received them from the mother is rotting in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coffin_.'' Unworthy son,
coward, liar,--you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers
in dark rooms at night,--you, whose plots and wiles have brought a
violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,--you,
who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father's
heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered,
till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an
index even to your mind--you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no, no!'  (<font color='red'><b>the coward</b></font>)</div>returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated
charges.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Every word!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman word</b></font>)</div>cried the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`every word that has passed between
you and this detested villain, is known to me.  Shadows on the wall
have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the
persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and
almost the attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you
were morally if not really a party.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman word</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>no Monks</b></font>)</div>interposed Monks.  <div class="bookquote">`I--I knew nothing of that; I was going to
inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me.  I didn't know the
cause.  I thought it was a common quarrel.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow.
<div class="bookquote">`Will you disclose the whole?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, I will.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before
witnesses?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`That I promise too.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed
with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose
of attesting it?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If you insist upon that, I'll do that also,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You must do more than that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`Make restitution to
an innocent and unoffending child, for such he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is, although the
offspring of a guilty and most miserable love.  You have not forgotten
the provisions of the will.  Carry them into execution so far as your
brother is concerned, and then go where you please.  In this world you
need meet no more.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks
on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it:  torn by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
fears on the one hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hatred on the other:  the door was
hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman -LRB-Mr. Losberne-RRB- entered the room in
violent agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The man will be taken,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be taken to-night!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The murderer?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Brownlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other.  <div class="bookquote">`His (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) dog has been seen lurking about
some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) master either is,
or will be, there, under cover of the darkness.  Spies are hovering
about in every direction.  I have spoken to the men who are charged
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) capture, and they tell me he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) cannot escape.  A reward of a
hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I will give fifty more,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`and proclaim it with my
own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it.  Where is Mr. Maylie?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Harry?  As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with
you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) hurried off to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) heard this,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`and
mounting his (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place
in the outskirts agreed upon between them.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`what of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`When I last heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had not been taken, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) will be, or is, by
this time.  They're sure of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Have you made up your mind?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of
Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) replied.  <div class="bookquote">`You--you--will be secret with me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I will.  Remain here till I return.  It is your only hope of safety.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They left the room, and the door was again locked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What have you done?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the doctor in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`All that I could hope to do, and even more.  Coupling the poor girl's
intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good
friend's inquiries on the spot, I left him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) no loophole of escape, and
laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day.
Write and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the
meeting.  We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require
rest:  especially the young lady, who _may_ have greater need of
firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now.  But my blood
boils to avenge this poor murdered creature.  Which way have they
taken?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Drive straight to the office and you will be in time,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>replied Mr.
Losberne.  <div class="bookquote">`I will remain here.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div><p/>The two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement
wholly uncontrollable.



<p/>CHAPTER L

<p/>THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE

<p/>Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe
abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on
the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of
close-built low-roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the
strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are
hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of
its inhabitants.

<p/>To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of
close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest
of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to
occasion.  The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the
shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at
the salesman's door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows.
Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class,
ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the
raff and refuse of the river, he (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) makes his (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) way with difficulty along,
assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which
branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of
ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks
of warehouses that rise from every corner.  Arriving, at length, in
streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) has
passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the
pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) passes, chimneys
half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron
bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign
of desolation and neglect.

<p/>In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark,
stands Jacob's Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet
deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill
Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch.  It is a
creek or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water
by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old
name.  At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden
bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the
houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows,
buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the
water up; and when his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eye is turned from these operations to the
houses themselves, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene
before him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).  Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen
houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows,
broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen
that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the
air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they
shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and
threatening to fall into it--as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls
and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every
loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the
banks of Folly Ditch.

<p/>In Jacob's Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are
crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling
into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke.
Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon
it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed.
The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by
those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die.
They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced
to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob's Island.

<p/>In an upper room of one of these houses--a detached house of fair size,
ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window:
of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already
described--there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other
every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation,
sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence.  One of these was
Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty
years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and
whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the
same occasion.  This man was a returned transport, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was
Kags.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I wish,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, <div class="bookquote">`that you had picked out
some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come
here, my fine feller.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why didn't you, blunder-head!'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Kags.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Well, I thought you'd have been a little more glad to see me than
this,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, look`e, young gentleman,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Toby, <div class="bookquote">`when a man keeps himself so
very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it's rather a
startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman
-LRB-however respectable and pleasant a person he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) may be to play cards with
at conweniency-RRB- circumstanced as you are.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Especially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping
with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), that's arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts,
and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) return,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Kags.

<p/>There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon
as hopeless any further effort to maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) usual devil-may-care
swagger, turned to Chitling and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`When was Fagin took then?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Just at dinner-time--two o'clock this afternoon.  Charley and I made
our lucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty
water-butt, head downwards; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) legs were so precious long that
they stuck out at the top, and so they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) too.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And Bet?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Poor Bet!  She (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>replied
Chitling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) countenance falling more and more, <div class="bookquote">`and went off mad,
screaming and raving, and beating her (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) head against the boards; so they
put a strait-weskut on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) to the hospital--and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>)
is.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Wot's come of young Bates?'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>demanded Kags.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)'ll be here
soon,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Chitling.  <div class="bookquote">`There's nowhere else to go to now, for the
people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken--I
went up there and see it with my own eyes--is filled with traps.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`This is a smash,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>observed Toby, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">`There's more than
one will go with this.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The sessions are on,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Kags:  <div class="bookquote">`if they get the inquest over, and
Bolter turns King's evidence:  as of course he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)'s
said already:  they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and
get the trial on on Friday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'ll swing in six days from this, by
G--!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You should have heard the people groan,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>said Chitling; <div class="bookquote">`the officers
fought like devils, or they'd have torn him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) away.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) was down once,
but they made a ring round him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>), and fought their way along.  You should
have seen how he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>), all muddy and bleeding, and clung to
them as if they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) dearest friends.  I can see 'em now, not able
to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) along
amongst 'em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and
snarling with their teeth and making at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>); I can see the blood upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked
themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore
they'd tear his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) heart out!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><p/>The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>)
ears, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro,
like one distracted.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their
eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs,
and Sikes's dog bounded into the room.  They ran to the window,
downstairs, and into the street.  The dog had jumped in at an open
window; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) made no attempt to follow them, nor was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) master to be
seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`What's the meaning of this?'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Toby when they had returned. <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)
can't be coming here.  I--I--hope not.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) was coming here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)'d have come with the dog,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Kags,
stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor.
<div class="bookquote">`Here!  Give us some water for him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) has run himself faint.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)'s drunk it all up, every drop,'  (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div>said Chitling after watching the
dog some time in silence.  <div class="bookquote">`Covered with mud--lame--half blind--he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) must
have come a long way.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Where can he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) have come from!'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Toby.  <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)'s been to the other
kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)'s been many a time and often.  But where can he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) have come from
first, and how comes he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) here alone without the other!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)' (<font color='red'><b>the murderer</b></font>)</div>---LRB-none of them called the murderer by his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) old name-RRB---`He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) can't
have made away with himself.  What do you think?' said Chitling.

<p/>Toby shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`If he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) had,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Kags, `the dog <div class="bookquote">`ud want to lead us away to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)
did it.  No.  I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)'s got out of the country, and left the dog
behind.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) must have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) the slip somehow, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) wouldn't be so
easy.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><p/>This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the
right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep,
without more notice from anybody.

<p/>It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and
placed upon the table.  The terrible events of the last two days had
made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and
uncertainty of their own position.  They drew their chairs closer
together, starting at every sound.  They spoke little, and that in
whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the
murdered woman lay in the next room.

<p/>They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried
knocking at the door below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Young Bates,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
felt himself.

<p/>The knocking came again.  No, it wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) never knocked like that.

<p/>Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) head.
There was no need to tell them who it was; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) pale face was enough.
The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`We must let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) in,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) said, taking up the candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Isn't there any help for it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the other man in a hoarse voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`None.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _must_ come in.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't leave us in the dark,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Kags, taking down a candle from the
chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the
knocking was twice repeated before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had finished.

<p/>Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the
lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) head under his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) hat.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) drew them slowly off.  Blanched face,
sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days' growth, wasted flesh,
short thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room,
but shuddering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall--as close as it
would go--and ground it against it--and sat down.

<p/>Not a word had been exchanged.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) looked from one to another in
silence.  If an eye were furtively raised and met his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), it was instantly
averted.  When his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hollow voice broke silence, they all three started.
They seemed never to have heard its tones before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`How came that dog here?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Alone.  Three hours ago.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`To-night's paper says that Fagin's took.  Is it true, or a lie?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`True.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were silent again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Damn you all!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Have you nothing to say to me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You that keep this house,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) face to Crackit,
<div class="bookquote">`do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You may stop here, if you think it safe,'  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>returned the person
addressed, after some hesitation.

<p/>Sikes carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes slowly up the wall behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>):  rather trying to
turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head than actually doing it:  and said, <div class="bookquote">`Is--it--the body--is
it buried?'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They shook their heads.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why isn't it!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) retorted with the same glance behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`Wot do
they keep such ugly things above the ground for?--Who's that knocking?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/>Crackit intimated, by a motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) left the room, that
there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).  Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy
entered the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) encountered his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Toby,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`why didn't you tell me this, downstairs?'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the
three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad.
Accordingly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nodded, and made as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Let me go into some other room,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, retreating still
farther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Charley!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, stepping forward.  <div class="bookquote">`Don't you--don't you know
me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't come nearer me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>answered the boy, still retreating, and
looking, with horror in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, upon the murderer's face.  <div class="bookquote">`You
monster!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes's
eyes sunk gradually to the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Witness you three,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the boy shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clenched fist, and
becoming more and more excited as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">`Witness you three--I'm not
afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--if they come here after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up; I will.
I tell you out at once.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) may kill me for it if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) likes, or if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
dares, but if I am here I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up.  I'd give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was to
be boiled alive.  Murder! Help!  If there's the pluck of a man among
you three, you'll help me.  Murder!  Help!  Down with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent
gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the
strong man, and in the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) energy and the suddenness of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) surprise, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heavily to the ground.

<p/>The three spectators seemed quite stupefied.  They offered no
interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the
former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), wrenching his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer's breast,
and never ceasing to call for help with all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might.

<p/>The contest, however, was too unequal to last long.  Sikes had him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)
down, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) knee was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) throat, when Crackit pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) back with
a look of alarm, and pointed to the window.  There were lights gleaming
below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried
footsteps--endless they seemed in number--crossing the nearest wooden
bridge.  One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there
was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement.  The gleam of
lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on.
Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from
such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Help!'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s here!  Break down the door!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`In the King's name,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry
arose again, but louder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Break down the door!'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>screamed the boy.  <div class="bookquote">`I tell you they'll never
open it.  Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the
door!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower
window-shutters as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the
crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of
its immense extent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching
Hell-babe,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the
boy, now, as easily as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were an empty sack. <div class="bookquote">`That door.  Quick!'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flung him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in, bolted it, and turned the key.  <div class="bookquote">`Is the downstairs
door fast?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Double-locked and chained,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>replied Crackit, who, with the other two
men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The panels--are they strong?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Lined with sheet-iron.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And the windows too?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, and the windows.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Damn you!'  (<font color='red'><b>the ruffian</b></font>)</div>cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and
menacing the crowd.  <div class="bookquote">`Do your worst!  I'll cheat you yet!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could
exceed the cry of the infuriated throng.  Some shouted to those who
were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to
shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>officers</b></font>) dead.  Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on
horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting
through the crowd as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were parting water, cried, beneath the
window, in a voice that rose above all others, <div class="bookquote">`Twenty guineas to the
man who brings a ladder!'

 (<font color='red'><b>all others</b></font>)</div><p/>The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it.  Some
called for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to
and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some
spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed
forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of
those below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the
water-spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the
darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind:  and
joined from time to time in one loud furious roar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The tide,'  (<font color='red'><b>the murderer</b></font>)</div>cried the murderer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) staggered back into the room, and
shut the faces out, <div class="bookquote">`the tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a
long rope.  They're all in front.  I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and
clear off that way.  Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders
and kill myself.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the
murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up
to the house-top.

<p/>All the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up,
except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that
was too small even for the passage of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) body.  But, from this
aperture, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the
back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by
the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in
front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in
an unbroken stream.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) planted a board, which he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had carried up with him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) for the purpose,
so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty
to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over
the low parapet.

<p/>The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.

<p/>The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>)
motions and doubtful of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) purpose, but the instant they perceived it
and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to
which all their previous shouting had been whispers.  Again and again
it rose.  Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning,
took up the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the
whole city had poured its population out to curse him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>).

<p/>On pressed the people from the front--on, on, on, in a strong
struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch
to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion.
The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the
mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and
tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging
to every house-top.  Each little bridge -LRB-and there were three in sight-RRB-
bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it.  Still the current poured
on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only
for an instant see the wretch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`They have him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) now,'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>cried a man on the nearest bridge. <div class="bookquote">`Hurrah!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I will give fifty pounds,'  (<font color='red'><b>an gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried an old gentleman from the same
quarter, <div class="bookquote">`to the man who takes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alive.  I will remain here, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
come to ask me for it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>an gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another roar.  At this moment the word was passed among the
crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who had first
called for the ladder had mounted into the room.  The stream abruptly
turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at
the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their
stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now
thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left:  each man crushing and
striving with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near
the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out.
The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation,
or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were
dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time,
between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and
the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the
mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer,
although the universal eagerness for his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) capture was, if possible,
increased.

<p/>The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the
crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change
with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sprang upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet,
determined to make one last effort for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life by dropping into the
ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in
the darkness and confusion.

<p/>Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within
the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
set his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the
rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong
running noose by the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and teeth almost in a second.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the
ground than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own height, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knife ready in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to cut
it then and drop.

<p/>At the very instant when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought the loop over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head previous to
slipping it beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm-pits, and when the old gentleman
before-mentioned -LRB-who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge
as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) position-RRB- earnestly
warned those about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that the man was about to lower himself down--at
that very instant the murderer, looking behind him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) on the roof, threw
his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) arms above his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) head, and uttered a yell of terror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The eyes again!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) cried in an unearthly screech.

<p/>Staggering as if struck by lightning, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) balance and tumbled
over the parapet.  The noose was on his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) neck. It ran up with his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>)
weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds.  He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>)
fell for five-and-thirty feet.  There was a sudden jerk, a terrific
convulsion of the limbs; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) hung, with the open knife
clenched in his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) stiffening hand.

<p/>The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The
murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside
the dangling body which obscured his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) view, called to the people to come
and take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out, for God's sake.

<p/>A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on
the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring,
jumped for the dead man's shoulders. Missing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aim, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell into the
ditch, turning completely over as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went; and striking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head
against a stone, dashed out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brains.



<p/>CHAPTER LI

<p/>AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING
A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEY

<p/>The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when
Oliver found himself, at three o'clock in the afternoon, in a
travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) native town.  Mrs. Maylie,
and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>):  and Mr.
Brownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person
whose name had not been mentioned.

<p/>They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of
agitation and uncertainty which deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) of the power of collecting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less
effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr.
Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from
Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey
was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole
matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in
endurance of the most intense suspense.

<p/>The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne's assistance, cautiously
stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive
intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place.
<div class="bookquote">`It was quite true,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`that they must know them before long,
but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be
at a worse.'   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So, they travelled on in silence:  each busied with
reflections on the object which had brought them together:  and no one
disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.

<p/>But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they
journeyed towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) birth-place by a road he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had never seen, how the
whole current of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recollections ran back to old times, and what a
crowd of emotions were wakened up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) breast, when they turned into
that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had traversed on foot:  a poor houseless, wandering boy,
without a friend to help him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), or a roof to shelter his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`See there, there!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose,
and pointing out at the carriage window; <div class="bookquote">`that's the stile I came over;
there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake
me and force me back!  Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to
the old house where I was a little child!  Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old
friend, if I could only see you now!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You will see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) soon,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, gently taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) folded hands
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) own.  <div class="bookquote">`You shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) how happy you are, and how rich
you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great
as the coming back to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) happy too.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, <div class="bookquote">`and we'll--we'll take him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) away from here, and
have him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clothed and taught, and send him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to some quiet country place
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) may grow strong and well,--shall we?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Rose nodded <div class="bookquote">`yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>for the boy was smiling through such happy tears
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) could not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You will be kind and good to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), for you are to every one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said
Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) can tell; but
never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile
again--I know that too--to think how changed he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is; you did the same
with me.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said ``God bless you'' to me when I ran away,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the boy
with a burst of affectionate emotion; <div class="bookquote">`and I will say ``God bless you''
now, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) how I love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for it!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow
streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy
within reasonable bounds.  There was Sowerberry's the undertaker's just
as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>)
remembered it--there were all the well-known shops and houses, with
almost every one of which he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had some slight incident connected--there
was Gamfield's cart, the very cart he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) used to have, standing at the old
public-house door--there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>)
youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street--there
was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver
involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so
foolish, then cried, then laughed again--there were scores of faces at
the doors and windows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew quite well--there was nearly
everything as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had left it but yesterday, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recent life
had been but a happy dream.

<p/>But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality.  They drove straight to the
door of the chief hotel -LRB-which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe,
and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur
and size-RRB-; and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing
the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness,
and not offering to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) head--no, not once; not even when he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and
maintained he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) knew it best, though he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had only come that way once, and
that time fast asleep.  There was dinner prepared, and there were
bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.

<p/>Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was
over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their
journey down.  Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained
in a separate room.  The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with
anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present,
conversed apart.  Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being
absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping.
All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets,
nervous and uncomfortable.  They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they
exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to
hear the sound of their own voices.

<p/>At length, when nine o'clock had come, and they began to think they
were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered
the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost
shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) brother,
and it was the same man he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had met at the market-town, and seen looking
in with Fagin at the window of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) little room.  Monks cast a look of
hate, which, even then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could not dissemble, at the astonished boy,
and sat down near the door.  Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hand,
walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This is a painful task,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`but these declarations, which have
been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance
repeated here.  I would have spared you the degradation, but we must
hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Go on,'  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>said the person addressed, turning away his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">`Quick.  I
have almost done enough, I think.  Don't keep me here.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`This child,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">`is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your
father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who
died in giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Edwin</b></font>) birth.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy:  the beating of whose
heart he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might have heard.  <div class="bookquote">`That is the bastard child.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The term you use,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, <div class="bookquote">`is a reproach to those
long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It reflects
disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
was born in this town.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`In the workhouse of this town,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the sullen reply. <div class="bookquote">`You have the
story there.'   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) pointed impatiently to the papers as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I must have it here, too,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the
listeners.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Listen then!  You!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>returned Monks.  <div class="bookquote">`His (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) father being taken ill at
Rome, was joined by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) wife, my mother, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had been long
separated, who went from Paris and took me with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
property, for what I know, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no great affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), nor
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) knew nothing of us, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) senses were gone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
slumbered on till next day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) died.  Among the papers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
desk, were two, dated on the night his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) illness first came on, directed
to yourself' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`and enclosed in a
few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package
that it was not to be forwarded till after he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was dead.  One of these
papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What of the letter?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Brownlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The letter?--A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a
penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had palmed a
tale on the girl that some secret mystery--to be explained one
day--prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) just then; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had gone on,
trusting patiently to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), until she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) trusted too far, and lost what
none could ever give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, at that time, within a few
months of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) confinement.  He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had meant to do, to hide
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shame, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had lived, and prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) died, not to curse
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) or their young child; for all the guilt was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
of the day he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the little locket and the ring with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
hoped one day to have bestowed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) yet to keep it, and
wear it next her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had done before--and then ran on,
wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gone
distracted.  I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver's tears fell fast.

<p/>Monks was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`was in the same
spirit as the letter.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) talked of miseries which his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) wife had brought
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>); of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature
bad passions of you his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) only son, who had been trained to hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>); and
left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds.
The bulk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) property he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) divided into two equal portions--one for
Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born
alive, and ever come of age.  If it were a girl, it was to inherit the
money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) minority he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should never have stained his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name with any public act
of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong.  He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did this, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, to
mark his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) confidence in the other, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) conviction--only strengthened
by approaching death--that the child would share her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gentle heart, and
noble nature.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were disappointed in this expectation, then the
money was to come to you:  for then, and not till then, when both
children were equal, would he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) recognise your prior claim upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
purse, who had none upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with coldness and aversion.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`My mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, in a louder tone, <div class="bookquote">`did what a woman should
have done.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) burnt this will.  The letter never reached its
destination; but that, and other proofs, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept, in case they ever
tried to lie away the blot.  The girl's father had the truth from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
with every aggravation that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) violent hate--I love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for it
now--could add.  Goaded by shame and dishonour he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fled with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
children into a remote corner of Wales, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) very name that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
friends might never know of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) retreat; and here, no great while
afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was found dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bed.  The girl had left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) home,
in secret, some weeks before; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had searched for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), on foot, in
every town and village near; it was on the night when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) returned home,
assured that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had destroyed herself, to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shame and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), that
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old heart broke.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread
of the narrative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Years after this,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`this man's--Edward Leeford's--mother came
to me.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Leeford</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), when only eighteen; robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of jewels and
money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London:  where for two
years he (<font color='blue'><b>Leeford</b></font>) had associated with the lowest outcasts.  She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sinking
under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him (<font color='blue'><b>Leeford</b></font>) before
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died.  Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They
were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leeford</b></font>) went
back with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to France.'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`There she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, <div class="bookquote">`after a lingering illness; and, on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
death-bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved--though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before.  She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child
too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been
born, and was alive.  I swore to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), if ever it crossed my path, to
hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and
most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply
felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by
draggin it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot.  She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was right. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
came in my way at last.  I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I
would have finished as I began!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>As the villain folded his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) arms tight together, and muttered curses on
himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the
terrified group beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), and explained that the Jew, who had been
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver
ensnared:  of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
being rescued:  and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit
to the country house for the purpose of identifying him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The locket and ring?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them
from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>answered Monks without
raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) eyes.  <div class="bookquote">`You know what became of them.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great
alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
unwilling consort after him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do my hi's deceive me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm,
<div class="bookquote">`or is that little Oliver?  Oh O-li-ver, if you know'd how I've been
a-grieving for you--'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue, fool,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Isn't natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?'  (<font color='red'><b>the workhouse master</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the workhouse master.
<div class="bookquote">`Can't I be supposed to feel--_I_ as brought him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) up porochially--when I
see him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest
description!  I always loved that boy as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d been my--my--my own
grandfather,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.
<div class="bookquote">`Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the
white waistcoat?  Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with
plated handles, Oliver.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Come, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; <div class="bookquote">`suppress your feelings.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I will do my endeavours, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble.  <div class="bookquote">`How do you do,
sir?  I hope you are very well.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to
within a short distance of the respectable couple.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) inquired, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
pointed to Monks,

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you know that person?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps _you_ don't?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) spouse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) in all my life,'  (<font color='red'><b>spouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Nor sold him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) anything, perhaps?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brownlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Certainly not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied the matron.  <div class="bookquote">`Why are we brought here to
answer to such nonsense as this?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman
limped away with extraordinary readiness.  But not again did he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) return
with a stout man and wife; for this time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) led in two palsied women,
who shook and tottered as they walked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`You shut the door the night old Sally died,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the foremost one,
raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) shrivelled hand, <div class="bookquote">`but you couldn't shut out the sound, nor
stop the chinks.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, looking round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) and wagging her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) toothless
jaws.  <div class="bookquote">`No, no, no.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`We heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) try to tell you what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'d done, and saw you take a paper
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker's
shop,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added the second, <div class="bookquote">`and it was a ``locket and gold ring.'' We found
out that, and saw it given you.  We were by.  Oh! we were by.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And we know more than that,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>resumed the first, <div class="bookquote">`for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) told us
often, long ago, that the young mother had told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that, feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
should never get over it, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) way, at the time that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Grimwig with
a motion towards the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the woman; <div class="bookquote">`if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pointed to Monks--`has been coward
enough to confess, as I see he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) has, and you have sounded all these hags
till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say.  I
_did_ sell them, and they're where you'll never get them.  What then?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`except that it remains for us to take
care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again.
You may leave the room.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I hope,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) with great ruefulness, as
Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: <div class="bookquote">`I hope that this
unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial
office?'

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Indeed it will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`You may make up your mind to
that, and think yourself well off besides.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It was all Mrs. Bumble.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) _would_ do it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>urged Mr. Bumble; first
looking round to ascertain that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) partner had left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That is no excuse,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`You were present on the
occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more
guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that
your wife acts under your direction.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If the law supposes that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat
emphatically in both hands, <div class="bookquote">`the law is a ass--a idiot.  If that's the
eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) eye may be opened by experience--by experience.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble
fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat on very tight, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) pockets,
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) helpmate downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, <div class="bookquote">`give me your hand.
Do not tremble.  You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we
have to say.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If they have--I do not know how they can, but if they have--any
reference to me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, <div class="bookquote">`pray let me hear them at some other time.
I have not strength or spirits now.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nay,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nay the gentlman</b></font>)</div>returned the old gentlman, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">`you
have more fortitude than this, I am sure.  Do you know this young lady,
sir?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Nay the gentlman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I never saw you before,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Rose faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I have seen you often,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>returned Monks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The father of the unhappy Agnes had _two_ daughters,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`What was the fate of the other--the child?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The child,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Monks, <div class="bookquote">`when her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father died in a strange place,
in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that
yielded the faintest clue by which his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends or relatives could be
traced--the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it
as their own.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Go on,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach. <div class="bookquote">`Go on!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You couldn't find the spot to which these people had repaired,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said
Monks, <div class="bookquote">`but where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way.  My
mother found it, after a year of cunning search--ay, and found the
child.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took it, did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`No.  The people were poor and began to sicken--at least the man
did--of their fine humanity; so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left it with them, giving them a
small present of money which would not last long, and promised more,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never meant to send.  She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't quite rely, however, on
their discontent and poverty for the child's unhappiness, but told the
history of the sister's shame, with such alterations as suited her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>);
bade them take good heed of the child, for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) came of bad blood; and
told them she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or
other.  The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed
it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even
to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the
girl by chance, pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) home.  There was some cursed
spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
remained there and was happy.  I lost sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), two or three years
ago, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) no more until a few months back.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes.  Leaning on your arm.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`But not the less my niece,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting
girl in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) arms; <div class="bookquote">`not the less my dearest child.  I would not lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>)
now, for all the treasures of the world.  My sweet companion, my own
dear girl!'

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The only friend I ever had,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried Rose, clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`The
kindest, best of friends.  My heart will burst.  I cannot bear all
this.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest
creature that ever shed happiness on every one she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) knew,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Maylie, embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) tenderly. <div class="bookquote">`Come, come, my love, remember who this
is who waits to clasp you in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arms, poor child!  See here--look,
look, my dear!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not aunt,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) neck; <div class="bookquote">`I'll never
call her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) aunt--sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my
heart to love so dearly from the first!  Rose, dear, darling Rose!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in
the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred.  A father,
sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment.  Joy and
grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears:  for
even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and
tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all
character of pain.

<p/>They were a long, long time alone.  A soft tap at the door, at length
announced that some one was without.  Oliver opened it, glided away,
and gave place to Harry Maylie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I know it all,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl. <div class="bookquote">`Dear
Rose, I know it all.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am not here by accident,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) added after a lengthened silence; <div class="bookquote">`nor
have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday--only
yesterday.  Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Stay,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose.  <div class="bookquote">`You _do_ know all.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`All.  You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the
subject of our last discourse.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I did.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not to press you to alter your determination,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>pursued the young man,
<div class="bookquote">`but to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay whatever of
station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still
adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or
act, to seek to change it.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose firmly.  <div class="bookquote">`If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>),
whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when
should I ever feel it, as I should to-night?  It is a struggle,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said
Rose, <div class="bookquote">`but one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall
bear.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`The disclosure of to-night,' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>--Harry began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The disclosure of to-night,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose softly, <div class="bookquote">`leaves me in the
same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You harden your heart against me, Rose,'  (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div>urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh Harry, Harry,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady, bursting into tears; <div class="bookquote">`I wish I
could, and spare myself this pain.'

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then why inflict it on yourself?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`Think,
dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`And what have I heard!  What have I heard!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried Rose. <div class="bookquote">`That a sense
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shunned
all--there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not yet, not yet,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, detaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) rose.  <div class="bookquote">`My
hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling:  every thought in life except my
love for you:  have undergone a change.  I offer you, now, no
distinction among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice
and detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught
but real disgrace and shame; but a home--a heart and home--yes, dearest
Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What do you mean!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I mean but this--that when I left you last, I left you with a firm
determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me;
resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine;
that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn
from it.  This I have done.  Those who have shrunk from me because of
this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right.  Such power
and patronage:  such relatives of influence and rank:  as smiled upon
me then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees
in England's richest county; and by one village church--mine, Rose, my
own!--there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of,
than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold.  This is
my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!'

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>*      *      *      *      *

<p/><div class="bookquote">`It's a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig,
waking up, and pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief from over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) head.

<p/>Truth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time.
Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose -LRB-who all came in together-RRB-,
could offer a word in extenuation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig,
<div class="bookquote">`for I began to think I should get nothing else.  I'll take the
liberty, if you'll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the
blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by
the doctor and Mr. Brownlow:  some people affirm that Harry Maylie had
been observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the
best authorities consider this downright scandal:  he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) being young and a
clergyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Oliver, my child,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`where have you been, and why do
you look so sad?  There are tears stealing down your face at this
moment.  What is the matter?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/>It is a world of disappointment:  often to the hopes we most cherish,
and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.

<p/>Poor Dick was dead!



<p/>CHAPTER LII

<p/>FAGIN'S LAST NIGHT ALIVE

<p/>The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive
and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before
the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the
galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man--Fagin.  Before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) and
behind:  above, below, on the right and on the left:  he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) seemed to
stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand
resting on the wooden slab before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), the other held to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) ear, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head thrust forward to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to catch with greater
distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was
delivering his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) charge to the jury.  At times, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) eyes
sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight
in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) favour; and when the points against him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) were stated with
terrible distinctness, looked towards his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) counsel, in mute appeal that
he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) would, even then, urge something in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) behalf.  Beyond these
manifestations of anxiety, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) stirred not hand or foot.  He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had
scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to
speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) still remained in the same strained attitude of close
attention, with his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) gaze bent on him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), as though he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) listened still.

<p/>A slight bustle in the court, recalled him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) to himself.  Looking round,
he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict.
As his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) eyes wandered to the gallery, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could see the people rising
above each other to see his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) face:  some hastily applying their glasses
to their eyes:  and others whispering their neighbours with looks
expressive of abhorrence.  A few there were, who seemed unmindful of
him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could
delay.  But in no one face--not even among the women, of whom there
were many there--could he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) read the faintest sympathy with himself, or
any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) should be
condemned.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness
came again, and looking back he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) saw that the jurymen had turned towards
the judge.  Hush!

<p/>They only sought permission to retire.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed
out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was
fruitless.  The jailer touched him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) on the shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) followed
mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair.  The man
pointed it out, or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have seen it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up into the gallery again.  Some of the people were eating,
and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place
was very hot.  There was one young man sketching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face in a little
note-book.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the
artist broke his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) pencil-point, and made another with his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) knife, as any
idle spectator might have done.

<p/>In the same way, when he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) eyes towards the judge, his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) mind
began to busy itself with the fashion of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) dress, and what it cost,
and how he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) put it on.  There was an old fat gentleman on the bench,
too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back.  He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dinner,
what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had it; and pursued this train of
careless thought until some new object caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye and roused
another.

<p/>Not that, all this time, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind was, for an instant, free from one
oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet; it
was ever present to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but in a vague and general way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
not fix his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts upon it.  Thus, even while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trembled, and turned
burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell to counting the iron
spikes before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and wondering how the head of one had been broken
off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was.  Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold--and stopped
to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it--and then went on to
think again.

<p/>At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all
towards the door.  The jury returned, and passed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) close. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone.
Perfect stillness ensued--not a rustle--not a breath--Guilty.

<p/>The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another,
and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled
out, like angry thunder.  It was a peal of joy from the populace
outside, greeting the news that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would die on Monday.

<p/>The noise subsided, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had anything to say why
sentence of death should not be passed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
listening attitude, and looked intently at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) questioner while the
demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to hear it,
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only muttered that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an old man--an old man--and so,
dropping into a whisper, was silent again.

<p/>The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the
same air and gesture.  A woman in the gallery, uttered some
exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) looked hastily up
as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively.
The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve.  His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
haggard face was still thrust forward, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) under-jaw hanging down, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes staring out before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), when the jailer put his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>)
arm, and beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) away.  He (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) gazed stupidly about him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) for an
instant, and obeyed.

<p/>They led him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners
were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their
friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard.
There was nobody there to speak to _him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>)_; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) passed, the
prisoners fell back to render him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) more visible to the people who were
clinging to the bars:  and they assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) with opprobrious names,
and screeched and hissed.  He (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) fist, and would have spat upon
them; but his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) conductors hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) on, through a gloomy passage
lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.

<p/>Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) was searched, that he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) might not have about him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) the means of
anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) to one of
the condemned cells, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) there--alone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat
and bedstead; and casting his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to
collect his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) thoughts. After awhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) began to remember a few
disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), at the time, that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could not hear a word.  These gradually
fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more:  so that
in a little time he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had the whole, almost as it was delivered.  To be
hanged by the neck, till he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was dead--that was the end.  To be hanged
by the neck till he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was dead.

<p/>As it came on very dark, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) began to think of all the men he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had known
who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) means.  They
rose up, in such quick succession, that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could hardly count them.  He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
had seen some of them die,--and had joked too, because they died with
prayers upon their lips.  With what a rattling noise the drop went
down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to
dangling heaps of clothes!

<p/>Some of them might have inhabited that very cell--sat upon that very
spot.  It was very dark; why didn't they bring a light?  The cell had
been built for many years.  Scores of men must have passed their last
hours there.  It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead
bodies--the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) knew,
even beneath that hideous veil.--Light, light!

<p/>At length, when his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hands were raw with beating against the heavy door
and walls, two men appeared:  one bearing a candle, which he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) thrust
into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall:  the other dragging in
a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left
alone no more.

<p/>Then came the night--dark, dismal, silent night.  Other watchers are
glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming
day.  To him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) they brought despair.  The boom of every iron bell came
laden with the one, deep, hollow sound--Death. What availed the noise
and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)?
It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning.

<p/>The day passed off.  Day?  There was no day; it was gone as soon as
come--and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in
its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours.  At one time he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hair.
Venerable men of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own persuasion had come to pray beside him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
had driven them away with curses.  They renewed their charitable
efforts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) beat them off.

<p/>Saturday night.  He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had only one night more to live.  And as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) thought
of this, the day broke--Sunday.

<p/>It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering
sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) blighted soul; not that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had ever held any defined or positive
hope of mercy, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had never been able to consider more than
the dim probability of dying so soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had spoken little to either of
the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>); and
they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) attention.  He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had
sat there, awake, but dreaming.  Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) started up, every minute, and
with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a
paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they--used to such
sights--recoiled from him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) with horror.  He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) grew so terrible, at last,
in all the tortures of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) evil conscience, that one man could not bear
to sit there, eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) alone; and so the two kept watch together.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) cowered down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stone bed, and thought of the past. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had
been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
capture, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) head was bandaged with a linen cloth.  His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) red hair
hung down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) bloodless face; his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) beard was torn, and twisted into
knots; his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes shone with a terrible light; his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) unwashed flesh
crackled with the fever that burnt him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) up. Eight--nine--then.  If it
was not a trick to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and those were the real hours treading
on each other's heels, where would he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) be, when they came round again!
Eleven!  Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had
ceased to vibrate.  At eight, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would be the only mourner in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own
funeral train; at eleven--

<p/>Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and
such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and
too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as
that.  The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man
was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that
night, if they could have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two
and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with
anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received.  These being
answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to
clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built,
and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the
scene.  By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the
dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.

<p/>The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers,
painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the
pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared
at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner,
signed by one of the sheriffs.  They were immediately admitted into the
lodge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man whose duty it
was to conduct them.  <div class="bookquote">`It's not a sight for children, sir.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It is not indeed, my friend,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`but my business
with this man is intimately connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>); and as this child has
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) in the full career of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) success and villainy, I think it as
well--even at the cost of some pain and fear--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
now.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver.
The man touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity,
opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and
led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`This,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man place</b></font>)</div>said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of
workmen were making some preparations in profound silence--`this is the
place he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passes through.  If you step this way, you can see the door he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
goes out at.'

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the
prison food, and pointed to a door.  There was an open grating above
it, through which came the sound of men's voices, mingled with the
noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards.  There were
putting up the scaffold.

<p/>From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by
other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard,
ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row
of strong doors on the left hand.  Motioning them to remain where they
were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bunch of keys. The
two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage,
stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned
the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell.  They did so.

<p/>The condemned criminal was seated on his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) bed, rocking himself from side
to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the
face of a man.  His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind was evidently wandering to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old life, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence
otherwise than as a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Good boy, Charley--well done--'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) mumbled.  <div class="bookquote">`Oliver, too, ha! ha! ha!
Oliver too--quite the gentleman now--quite the--take that boy away to
bed!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The jailer</b></font>)</div><p/>The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) not
to be alarmed, looked on without speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) away to bed!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`Do you hear me, some of you?  He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
has been the--the--somehow the cause of all this.  It's worth the money
to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) up to it--Bolter's throat, Bill; never mind the
girl--Bolter's throat as deep as you can cut.  Saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) head off!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>said the jailer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's me!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of
listening he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had assumed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) trial.  <div class="bookquote">`An old man, my Lord; a very
old, old man!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Here,'  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>said the turnkey, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
down.  <div class="bookquote">`Here's somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I
suppose.  Fagin, Fagin!  Are you a man?'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I shan't be one long,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) replied, looking up with a face retaining no
human expression but rage and terror.  <div class="bookquote">`Strike them all dead!  What
right have they to butcher me?'

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to
the furthest corner of the seat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) demanded to know what they wanted
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Steady,'  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>said the turnkey, still holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) down.  <div class="bookquote">`Now, sir, tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) what you want.  Quick, if you please, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) grows worse as the
time gets on.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`You have some papers,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow advancing, <div class="bookquote">`which were placed
in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It's all a lie together,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`I haven't one--not one.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`For the love of God,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, <div class="bookquote">`do not say that
now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are.  You
know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no
hope of any further gain.  Where are those papers?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin, beckoning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">`Here, here! Let me whisper
to you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am not afraid,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver in a low voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) relinquished Mr.
Brownlow's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`The papers,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`are in a canvas
bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room.  I
want to talk to you, my dear.  I want to talk to you.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Yes, yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>returned Oliver.  <div class="bookquote">`Let me say a prayer.  Do!  Let me say
one prayer.  Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk
till morning.'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Outside, outside,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) towards
the door, and looking vacantly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`Say I've gone to
sleep--they'll believe you.  You can get me out, if you take me so.
Now then, now then!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Oh!  God forgive this wretched man!'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the boy with a burst of
tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`That's right, that's right,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`That'll help us on. This
door first.  If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don't you
mind, but hurry on.  Now, now, now!'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Have you nothing else to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>inquired the turnkey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`No other question,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow.  <div class="bookquote">`If I hoped we could recall
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) to a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) position--'

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Nothing will do that, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`You
had better leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).'

 (<font color='red'><b>the attendants</b></font>)</div><p/>The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Press on, press on,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin.  <div class="bookquote">`Softly, but not so slow. Faster,
faster!'

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The men laid hands upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), and disengaging Oliver from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) grasp,
held him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) back.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) struggled with the power of desperation, for an
instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those
massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.

<p/>It was some time before they left the prison.  Oliver nearly swooned
after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had not the strength to walk.

<p/>Day was dawning when they again emerged.  A great multitude had already
assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing
cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking.
Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects
in the centre of all--the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and
all the hideous apparatus of death.



<p/>CHAPTER LIII

<p/>AND LAST

<p/>The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed.
The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few
and simple words.

<p/>Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were
married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of
the young clergyman's labours; on the same day they entered into
possession of their new and happy home.

<p/>Mrs. Maylie took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) abode with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) son and daughter-in-law, to
enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) days, the greatest felicity
that age and worth can know--the contemplation of the happiness of
those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a
well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed.

<p/>It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of
property remaining in the custody of Monks -LRB-which had never prospered
either in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hands or in those of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother-RRB- were equally divided
between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than
three thousand pounds.  By the provisions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) father's will, Oliver
would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to
deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) former vices
and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) young charge joyfully acceded.

<p/>Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) portion to a
distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
once more fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) old courses, and, after undergoing a long
confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk
under an attack of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) old disorder, and died in prison.  As far from
home, died the chief remaining members of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) friend Fagin's gang.

<p/>Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) son.  Removing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) and the old
housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) dear
friends resided, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver's warm
and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose
condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever
be known in this changing world.

<p/>Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned
to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) old friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would
have been discontented if his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) temperament had admitted of such a
feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had known how.  For
two or three months, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) contented himself with hinting that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) feared
the air began to disagree with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); then, finding that the place really
no longer was, to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), what it had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) settled his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) business on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
assistant, took a bachelor's cottage outside the village of which his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered.  Here he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) took
to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other
pursuits of a similar kind:  all undertaken with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) characteristic
impetuosity.  In each and all he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has since become famous throughout the
neighborhood, as a most profound authority.

<p/>Before his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) removal, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had managed to contract a strong friendship for
Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)
is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course
of the year.  On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and
carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and
unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) favourite
asseveration, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) mode is the right one.  On Sundays, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) never
fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman's face:  always
informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>)
considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say
so.  It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to
rally him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) of
the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) was right in the main, and, in
proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which
always calls forth a laugh on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) side, and increases his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) good humour.

<p/>Mr. Noah Claypole:  receiving a free pardon from the Crown in
consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin:  and considering
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) profession not altogether as safe a one as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could wish:  was, for
some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened
with too much work.  After some consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) went into business as
an Informer, in which calling he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) realises a genteel subsistence.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)
plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by
Charlotte in respectable attire.  The lady faints away at the doors of
charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with
three-penny worth of brandy to restore her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), lays an information next
day, and pockets half the penalty.  Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints
himself, but the result is the same.

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually
reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in
that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.
Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)
wife.

<p/>As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts,
although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey.  They
sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among
its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to
this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which
establishment they properly belong.

<p/>Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes's crime, fell into a train of
reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best.
Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) back
upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of
action.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but,
having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the
end; and, from being a farmer's drudge, and a carrier's lad, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is now
the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.

<p/>And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches
the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space,
the thread of these adventures.

<p/>I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long
moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it.  I would
show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood,
shedding on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell
on all who trod it with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and shone into their hearts.  I would
paint her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively
summer group; I would follow her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) through the sultry fields at noon, and
hear the low tones of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I
would watch her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in all her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling
untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dead sister's child happy in their love for one another, and
passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so
sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little
faces that clustered round her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knee, and listen to their merry prattle;
I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the
sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye.  These, and a
thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech--I would
fain recall them every one.

<p/>How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>),
more and more, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) nature developed itself, and showed the thriving
seeds of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) to become--how he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) traced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) new traits
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) early friend, that awakened in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) own bosom old remembrances,
melancholy and yet sweet and soothing--how the two orphans, tried by
adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love,
and fervent thanks to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) who had protected and preserved them--these
are all matters which need not to be told.  I have said that they were
truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and
gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute
is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be
attained.

<p/>Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble
tablet, which bears as yet but one word:  <div class="bookquote">`AGNES.'   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There is no coffin
in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is
placed above it!  But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to
earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love--the love beyond the
grave--of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of
Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the
less because that nook is in a Church, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) was weak and erring.
